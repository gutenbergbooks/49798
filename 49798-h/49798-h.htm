<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">BACK FROM THE FISHING HOLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You know, boys, a whole lot depends on
what kind of weather we have during Fair
week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that, Arthur? You&rsquo;re the
weather-wise scout of Oakvale Troop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, give us your forecast, Arthur; has the
rain let up for keeps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as that goes, Alec, I notice in the
morning paper it&rsquo;s turned clear all the way
from the Rockies east, and that ought to mean
a good spell of several days for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless one of those howlers comes twisting
up the Atlantic coast from the West Indies;
you want to remember that the hurricane season
isn&rsquo;t quite over yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind in sight, and I always
look up every scrap of weather news in the
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me happy when you say that,
Arthur, old weather sharp. We get our afternoons
off from school while the County Fair
is on, because it&rsquo;s such a big thing for Oakvale
and vicinity. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out
what I can do to have a cracking good time of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we all, Tom, but there&rsquo;s no use trying
to hike off somewhere with the whole troop.
You can&rsquo;t do much on an afternoon. Why
couldn&rsquo;t they have fixed it so we would get free
the last half of the week, including Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell that to the school directors, Alec. Perhaps
they&rsquo;ll take pity on you and change the
programme. I doubt it, though. I reckon they
want the boys to be around while the Fair is
going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured out that my scheme is to hang
around the Exhibition and see the a&euml;roplane
man do his stunts every afternoon; but I&rsquo;d
rather be in camp any day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The three boys whose chatter opens this
chapter had been tramping along the main road
leading into the town of Oakvale, where they
all lived. It was on a Saturday afternoon in
early fall. That the lads had been spending
part of their holiday in fishing was in plain
evidence, for besides carrying either bamboo
poles or jointed rods, they dangled strings of
yellow perch, some of the catch being of extraordinary
size.</p>
<p>On their way home the boys had stopped
to scan a highly-colored poster on a billboard
at the side of the road, where people in the
passing trains nearby could also have the benefit
of the information thus blazoned forth.</p>
<p>About this time every year the big County
Fair was held on the extensive grounds near
the thriving town of Oakvale. If wonderful
promises meant anything at all the coming exhibition
of live stock, farm products, and the
like would far surpass anything heretofore
attempted.</p>
<p>Besides, there would be racing on the track,
amazing feats undertaken by an a&euml;roplane
aviator of national renown, balloon ascensions
accompanied by parachute drops, &ldquo;and other
attractions too numerous to mention.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Having looked over the poster and commented
on its most prominent features, the
trio of weary lads again turned their faces
toward home, now not half a mile away.</p>
<p>It might be noticed that all of them wore
rather faded suits of khaki, showing that they
belonged to the local troop of Boy Scouts. In
addition to the ordinary badges they also
proudly displayed certain merit badges to
prove that they had qualified along certain particular
lines of scoutcraft.</p>
<p>Another thing that might have been noticed
was that Alec, Tom and Arthur all displayed
bronze medals, which would tell anyone acquainted
with scout customs and laws that
these lads had saved human life at some time
in their past.</p>
<p>While, after rather an exhausting day, they
are trudging slowly toward home with heavy
feet, it may be a good time for us to take a
glimpse into the past, in order to understand
just who the three boys are, and also mention
a few important things in connection with the
troop to which they belong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The town of Oakvale lay in the East, and
not a great many miles away from the Atlantic
Ocean. Those who have read previous volumes
in the series know just why scout affairs
were booming in the town. The scout master,
Lieutenant Denmead, a retired army officer,
took the greatest delight in fostering a spirit
of manliness among the boys in his charge.
His assistant, Hugh Hardin, who was also the
leader of the Wolf Patrol, chanced to be a
wide-awake chap, and just the kind to push any
enterprise along to success.</p>
<p>The troop now consisted of five patrols, and
as a rule they were filled to their utmost capacity
of eight members each. The Wolf had
been first in the field, but as the interest grew
and new members joined, there had arisen the
Hawk, Otter, Fox and Owl Patrols.</p>
<p>Alec Sands was leader of the Otter, and had
at one time been a keen rival of Hugh Hardin;
but all hard feelings were eventually buried,
and they were warm friends. Arthur Cameron
proudly carried the patrol colors of the Wolf;
and while interested in wireless telegraphy,
weather predictions, and even photography,
perhaps his strongest point lay in his surprising
skill in amateur surgery and first aid to
the injured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Tom Sherwood was also an Otter, and a
husky fellow, fond of water sports, and with
a hobby along the lines of surveying work.</p>
<p>It can be readily seen from a casual glance
at some of the titles of previous books in
the series that the boys of Oakvale Troop had
passed through considerable experience well
worth while.</p>
<p>Since the opportunity to investigate for
themselves is open to all readers who would
like to learn more about these interesting
phases of their past, there is no necessity for
our taking up much space here in mentioning
details.</p>
<p>Still, it might not be amiss to say that in the
preceding spring, during the time of the heavy
rains, Hugh and several others of the troop
proved themselves to be of exceedingly great
value to the citizens of a town in another part
of the State. This was when a disastrous flood
threatened the community with destruction,
and human lives were placed in deadly peril
by the quickly rising water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>On that occasion Hugh had actually saved a
boy of the town who would otherwise have
been carried down with the bridge. His act
had been witnessed by hundreds of people, and
is talked about to the present day as a fine
example of presence of mind and prompt
action.</p>
<p>On account of having thus saved a human
life at great risk to himself, Hugh Hardin had
received from Headquarters a gold medal, the
highest honor that any scout can ever hope to
gain. Being a very modest fellow, however,
Hugh did not often wear this token of appreciation,
though he was proud of it all the same.</p>
<p>It may interest the new reader to know just
how Alec, Tom and Arthur came by the bronze
medals they wore. During the preceding summer
the main part of the troop had gone camping,
and it happened that at the time there was
a strike of laborers in a large cement works
not far distant. When the company imported
strike-breakers, and employed guards to protect
the property, the foreign strikers grew
furious.</p>
<p>So it came about that there was a serious
riot during which many of the ignorant strikers
were shot. It might have been called a
one-sided battle, for a dozen men, and some
women as well, were more or less seriously injured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>In this terrible crisis Hugh Hardin and some
of his scouts came on the scene. With the
usual promptness that characterized his actions,
Hugh had started a temporary field hospital.
Having learned the first principles of
caring for gunshot wounds he and Arthur,
assisted by others of the troop, managed to
stop the flow of blood in such a way that when
the Red Cross surgeon and nurses reached the
scene later on, they declared that the work
of the scouts merited the highest praise. Indeed,
they went even further, and said that
were it not for the prompt aid afforded by the
young surgeons one or more lives might have
been lost.</p>
<p>And since those wise gentlemen at the head
of the great movement for the uplift of boys
are always quick to recognize real merit, a
bronze medal had soon come to every member
of Oakvale Troop who had been instrumental
in the work of that field hospital.</p>
<p>Since that time things had gone as usual.
Some of the boys had gone on summer vacations.
Those who remained at home fished,
went swimming, played baseball, tennis, and
even camped for a week.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Then school had brought back the absent
ones, and once more scout affairs began to
pick up. Thanksgiving would be the next little
breathing spell. At present, the School
Board had decided that during the time of the
County Fair there was to be only a morning
session for all the scholars. Of course, this
was intended as a means for letting them
attend the Exhibition, and acquiring more or
less knowledge along many lines; for Oakvale
was proud of having been chosen as the regular
site for this yearly Fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you that I&rsquo;m not sorry to be
so near home,&rdquo; Tom Sherwood observed, after
they had arrived at the border of the town,
where the break-up of the little fishing party
would take place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t been wasting our day, understand,&rdquo;
added Alec, as he held up his fine
string of perch and noticed that one of them
still showed signs of life, in spite of the fact
that they had tried to knock each captive on
the head when taken so as to avoid needless
suffering, as every true scout should do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that hurrying this way, and waving
his hat?&rdquo; demanded Arthur. &ldquo;Looks like Billy
Worth&mdash;yes, there isn&rsquo;t another fellow in the
troop with his width.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his capacity for making away with
the grub when in camp, you want to add,&rdquo;
laughed Tom. &ldquo;But he certainly looks excited,
fellows. Listen to him giving the Wolf call,
will you? I wonder if anything can have happened
here in town since we started fishing this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very idea quickened their footsteps, and
in another minute they were joined by the stout
lad with the jolly face, who was one of the
original members of Oakvale Troop, as well as
a staunch supporter and admirer of his patrol
leader, Hugh Hardin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy the Wolf,&rdquo; as Billy Worth was sometimes
called, seemed to have been running, for
he was a little short of breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this mean, Billy?&rdquo; asked Alec,
with something of his old imperiousness, for
once upon a time Alec had been of a domineering
nature. &ldquo;Tell us why you&rsquo;re stopping us
on the highway like this? Has there been a
fire? Is the school burned to the ground?
Anybody sick, a runaway happened, a child
lost in the woods and the scouts needed to find
it? Speak up, can&rsquo;t you? and relieve this fierce
strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this way, fellows,&rdquo; said Billy,
between gulps, &ldquo;the Fair management has
asked the Oakvale Scouts to pitch a tent on
the grounds, show people how they live in
camp, act as guides to strangers in town, meet
trains at the station, set up an emergency cot
in another tent where first aid to the injured
can be found, and&mdash;and, pretty much run the
whole business this year! What d&rsquo;ye think of
that now for a big honor to Oakvale Troop?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE GREAT UNDERTAKING.</span></h2>
<p>There was a brief interval after Billy had
blurted out this astonishing news. The other
three scouts stared at one another as though
they could hardly grasp the full significance of
the information.</p>
<p>Then, as if a signal had been given, every
one of them dropped his fishpole and string
of finny trophies, snatched off his hat, and,
waving it above his head, let out a series of
cheers.</p>
<p>A mule that had been feeding in a lot near by
kicked up his heels and started galloping wildly
about his enclosure, doubtless under the impression
that war had been declared, and the
initial battle begun. A stray cur, in the act of
skulking past, sped furiously down the road,
evidently believing that it could almost hear
the clatter of a tin can tied to its tail, though
of course, scouts are never guilty of such a
cruel proceeding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great news you&rsquo;ve given us, Billy!&rdquo;
declared Alec. &ldquo;I can see that the good people
of our home town pin a lot of faith in Oakvale
Troop of Boy Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they ought to,&rdquo; said Billy promptly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve certainly been a credit to the community,&mdash;excuse
my blushes, boys. But our record
speaks for itself, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Tom Sherwood, &ldquo;and only for
the scouts, Oakvale to-day would be the same
dirty little old town it used to be, with waste
paper blowing all around, and nobody taking
any pride in keeping things spic and span. The
women all said they had tried to clean up and
failed; but when our troop offered to lend a
helping hand the improvement was effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too near supper time to do much talking
about the wonderful news you&rsquo;ve brought us,
Billy,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;ll be the
main line of topic of discussion at the regular
weekly meeting to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;and Hugh means to
&rsquo;phone every member he can reach, so there&rsquo;ll
be a heavy attendance. The Fair begins on
Wednesday, you remember, and we ought to
know just what we expect to do along a dozen
lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me as an elegant thing,&rdquo; asserted
Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finest that ever came down the pike,&rdquo; Billy
agreed. &ldquo;To think what glorious times we can
have, and how we&rsquo;ll be able to scatter seeds of
information about scout activities among the
rubes who attend the great Fair. Some of
them really believe scouts are banded together
just to play pranks and have fun. We&rsquo;ll have
the biggest opportunity to take the scales off
their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think, Billy,&rdquo; Arthur commented,
his eyes sparkling, &ldquo;that while we walked along
the road just now all of us were trying to figure
out what possible use only afternoon vacations
could be to boys, when it was impossible to go
off on any hike. Now we can see a dozen
ways where we&rsquo;ll be able to have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we all know what <i>you&rsquo;d</i> call a good
time, Arthur,&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;Chances are you&rsquo;ll
stick by that emergency tent hospital like a
leech, and almost hope some old farmer may
drop a pitchfork on his foot and need attending
to; or a dog bite a boy who&rsquo;s been badgering
him, so you&rsquo;ll have to cauterize the
wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; added Alec. &ldquo;Arthur is
never so happy as when he&rsquo;s making other people
miserable&mdash;of course, you understand what
I mean. In reality he&rsquo;s trying to relieve their
suffering and danger, even if it does hurt. But
I must get along, boys; it&rsquo;s six o&rsquo;clock, and we
have supper promptly at half-past. I&rsquo;m as
hungry as a wolf, if any of you know what
that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us think it means Billy the Wolf!&rdquo;
laughed Arthur, as he too started off, headed
for home, dangling his hard-earned string of
perch at his side.</p>
<p>The meeting that night was well attended,
for if there had been any dubious ones who
had fancied at one time they were really too
tired after a holiday to come out, the urgent
message from Hugh Hardin over the wire had
changed their minds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>It happened that Lieutenant Denmead was
out of town on some business connected with
a deceased brother&rsquo;s estate, so that the burden
of responsibility during the ensuing week was
bound to fall upon the shoulders of the assistant
scout master.</p>
<p>Not a single boy doubted the ability of Hugh
Hardin to fulfill the demands of the occasion.
They had seen him tested on many a field, and
it was the almost universal opinion, in which
Lieutenant Denmead himself joined, that
Hugh could manage things even better than
the regular scout master himself.</p>
<p>Considering that there was considerable
sickness in town (a number of boys were laid
up with mumps and kindred ailments), the
attendance at the meeting was creditable.</p>
<p>The old reliable Wolf Patrol carried off the
honors of the occasion, for every member answered
the roll-call; the Otter was next in line,
showing six present.</p>
<p>As some of these boys will figure more or
less in the pages of our story it may be wise
to mention the list of those at the meeting:</p>
<p>Wolf Patrol&mdash;Hugh Hardin (leader), Billy
Worth, Bud Morgan, Arthur Cameron, Ned
Twyford, Jack Durham, Harold Tremaine and
Ralph Kenyon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Otter Patrol&mdash;Alec Sands (leader), Buck
Winter, Chester Brownell, Dick Bellamy, Tom
Sherwood and Dane Evans.</p>
<p>Fox Patrol&mdash;Don Miller (leader), &ldquo;Shorty&rdquo;
McNeil, Cooper Fennimore, Spike Welling,
&ldquo;Monkey&rdquo; Stallings.</p>
<p>Owl Patrol&mdash;Lige Corbley (leader), &ldquo;Whistling&rdquo;
Smith, Andy Wallis and Pete Craig.</p>
<p>Hawk Patrol&mdash;Walter Osborne (leader),
Blake Merton, Gus Merrivale and Anthony
Huggins.</p>
<p>After the regular business of the meeting
had been hurriedly dispatched, twenty-seven
scouts then started in to talk matters over.
Of course most of them were perfectly willing
that others should lay out the plans and offer
suggestions. It is just as well that a few leading
spirits should manage things, for with the
whole twenty-seven trying to make themselves
heard, Bedlam would have been a quiet retreat
beside that meeting.</p>
<p>Hugh had evidently given the matter considerable
thought since receiving word from the
directors and managers of the County Fair
that an invitation was extended to the troop
to take charge of certain branches of industry
and usefulness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing every one of us must do,&rdquo;
Hugh told them, &ldquo;will be to brush up our
knowledge of what the Fair stands for, and
the location of every exhibit. For to be a guide
means that people expect you are a walking
encyclopedia, and you&rsquo;re apt to have all sorts
of queer questions fired at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess that&rsquo;s right, Hugh,&rdquo; said Walter
Osborne, &ldquo;because there will be lots of people
here who are utter strangers to Oakvale. I
know that my Uncle Reuben and Aunt Ruth
are coming on to stop over with us, and while
I visited at their place as a kid years ago,
they&rsquo;ve never been here before. There are
others, too, I&rsquo;ve heard, so each one of you
wants to kiss the Blarney Stone, and be ready
to talk like a Dutch uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday afternoon after school, then,
we&rsquo;ll go out to the grounds and get our two
tents up, as well as do a good many other
things,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I expect to see the school
principal, and try to have a couple of us excused
each morning, so that there will be some
one at the headquarters up to noon. In fact,
I mean to lay out a regular schedule, and let
each scout know just what special duty he is
to undertake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the finest things that ever
came our way, I think,&rdquo; remarked Don Miller.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope that after the Fair is over the
folks who have been thinking poorly of us
scouts will have a different opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be hoped that no one who wears the
khaki will do the first thing calculated to bring
it into disrepute,&rdquo; suggested Walter Osborne;
and some of them saw him cast a quick and
perhaps anxious glance toward the spot where
the leader of the latest patrol to be organized,
the Owl, was sitting.</p>
<p>It was in fact not so very long ago when
Lige Corbley had been something of a thorn
in the side of Hugh Hardin and the scouts. He
had scoffed at their aspirations, made sport of
their helpfulness to others, and seldom missed
an opportunity to annoy them. How it came
about that Big Lige saw the error of his ways,
and made such a complete change in his habits
that he actually joined the troop has been entertainingly
told in a preceding volume, so it
need not be recounted here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Lige knew that several of the boys, including
Walter, were not quite as sure of his loyalty
to the laws he had promised to obey, as
Hugh and the rest might be. He also understood
that this little shaft of suspicion was
meant for him; but Lige simply grinned, and
apparently paid no attention to it. As long
as Hugh had faith in his reformation he was
willing to stand for anything. Deeds, and not
promises, were what counted, and he believed
he was daily proving that he had cut aloof
from the old life forever.</p>
<p>After the subject was threshed out thoroughly,
so much had been said that some of
the fellows declared they hardly knew whether
they were standing on their heads or on their
heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But order will come out of chaos after a
bit, you know,&rdquo; said Alec, confidently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
always this way at first. By degrees the wheat
gets separated from the chaff, and in the end
things look clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to leave it all to Hugh!&rdquo; declared
Ralph Kenyon. &ldquo;Seems like he always
does know just what is best to do. I&rsquo;ve never
known him to get far astray in anything he
undertook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Ralph had good reason to feel this confidence
in the assistant scout master. He could
look back to the time when he knew absolutely
nothing of the finer motives that influence the
true scout; when he delighted in spending his
winters in trapping harmless little animals
both for the fun it afforded him, and the small
amount of money he received for their skins
when sold to dealers in furs.</p>
<p>Then Ralph had become acquainted with
Hugh, who had managed to convince him that
there must be many other ways of earning
money without giving pain to little creatures,
most of them harmless, and even taking their
lives away in the bargain. After his eyes had
been opened, Ralph Kenyon had spent more
time hunting wild ginseng roots, and found
that it profited him three times as much as his
former cruel occupation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet here again on Monday night,&rdquo;
said Hugh just then, as they prepared to leave
the room. &ldquo;By that time I&rsquo;ll have it all figured
out, and each one will receive his orders
in black and white. Mayor Strunk himself
came to see me, for you know he is the head of
the Fair management. He said he expected
great things of the scouts, because they had
made such great use of their opportunities in
the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Marsh is one of the managers, too, you
remember, fellows,&rdquo; said Blake Merton. &ldquo;His
wife is president of the Town Improvement
Association. She hasn&rsquo;t forgotten what we
did that time to make Oakvale a better place
to live in. These things all count. What our
boys do is sure to come back to them, just as
chickens come home to roost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, and I know it every day,&rdquo;
called out Lige Corbley. &ldquo;The hardest thing
any fellow ever tries to do is to live down a
reputation. Lots of people think they can see
the horns sticking out right along. They keep
saying it&rsquo;s only a little veneer or polish, and
will rub off. Some of &rsquo;em even try to help
rub it off; but thank goodness there are others
who stand by a fellow, and keep him from
going back on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>That was the most Lige had ever said before
the boys. Walter Osborne turned red
in the face with confusion. He felt heartily
ashamed of the sly little dig he had given
Lige earlier in the evening. Being a frank,
candid boy, Walter did not hesitate when he
saw his duty clear before him, for he immediately
walked straight up to Lige and thrust
out his hand, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve said anything to hurt your
feelings, Lige, and I don&rsquo;t care who hears me
tell it. Honestly, I&rsquo;m surprised that you&rsquo;ve
done as well as you have with such a handicap
on your shoulders. I couldn&rsquo;t do half as good
myself; and from this time on you&rsquo;ll never
hear a whisper from me. I&rsquo;m proud to shake
hands with you and call you my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the scouts separated it was in a
far more brotherly frame of mind because of
this manly action on the part of Walter
Osborne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">ON DUTY AT THE FAIR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be in good working
order now, Hugh. Even our emergency doctor,
Arthur, goes into the hospital tent every
ten minutes to mosey around; and I kind of
suspect he&rsquo;s almost wishing that some sort of
case would crop up just to let him show his
hand at first aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Billy Worth doing this talking.</p>
<p>The days had crept by, and now the Fair was
a thing of the present. It had really opened
with the usual ceremonies that noon, and a
throng of people kept pushing in through the
several gates, many of them coming from a
distance.</p>
<p>The scouts had been energetically at work
on the preceding afternoon and evening, some
of them getting up at dawn on Wednesday
morning in order to complete their arrangements
as far as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Two khaki-colored tents, supposed to be
waterproof in case of a drenching rain, had
been erected on the site given over to their
camp use. In one of these the boys had arranged
a couple of blanket beds, such as they
were in the habit of using when camping out
in the woods. These were complete, even to
fragrant hemlock browse under each blanket
to take the place of the comfortable mattresses
at home.</p>
<p>In fact, it was as decent a camp as the ingenuity
of the scouts could devise; a number of
the fellows gave it some finishing touches that
added much to its appearance. They knew
that thousands of visitors would manifest a
great deal of curiosity in their little model
camp. Many of them had no idea how boys
lived when on an outing and it was to disarm
criticism that all this trouble was taken.</p>
<p>The second tent was to be used as a temporary
hospital in case of accidents during the
progress of the Exhibition. There had never
been a season that someone did not get injured;
and in a crush women had often been
known to faint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>A number of the scouts hovered about the
camp, anxious to show the comfortable arrangements
for sleeping and cooking to their
folks, and strangers as well, for they felt a
commendable pride in what they had accomplished.</p>
<p>Others were abroad doing some of the many
things that had been handed over into their
charge. A couple waited at the railroad station
for the next incoming train, so as to meet
strangers, and either direct them to some place
where they could put up while staying in town,
or escort them straight to the gates of the
County Fair.</p>
<p>Still another lot of the scouts put in their
time roaming about the grounds, not only taking
in the sights with which they soon became
familiar, but also being constantly on the
watch for chances to make themselves useful.</p>
<p>This they could do in a thousand ways, if
they felt so disposed. Children that had
strayed away from their elders in the crowd;
tired mothers who did not know where to warm
the baby&rsquo;s milk, and were grateful for a little
aid; bewildered country people who sought information
concerning the best way to leave
their rigs so that they would be perfectly safe
while they did the sights&mdash;yes, there was
really no limit to the ways a wide-awake scout,
anxious to do his full duty, could extend that
helping hand&mdash;a part of his profession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Hugh was feeling pretty well satisfied with
the way things had started out. He knew
there might be a few little matters needing
alteration, but as a whole the camp was in
apple-pie order. They need not feel ashamed
to have it examined by any fair-minded critic.</p>
<p>A number of gentlemen had already manifested
a decided interest. They showered compliments
on the tidy manner in which the boys
had arranged things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a camp so well ordered,&rdquo; one
man had remarked, &ldquo;and all my life I&rsquo;ve been
going into the woods every summer and fall,
fishing and shooting. After this I must take
my guide to task and have things changed. If
boys can show such smartness, it&rsquo;s a burning
shame that a man is content to keep camp,
with his duffle littered about so that nothing is
in place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Those sort of things made Hugh feel as
though it paid every time to be thorough in all
he did, without appearing to be what boys call
a &ldquo;crank.&rdquo; One can keep his possessions in
decent order without making it such a hobby
that he becomes a bore to all his comrades.</p>
<p>The assistant scout master laughed when
Billy Worth made that remark about the anxiety
of Arthur Cameron to have his first patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re stretching things again, Billy,
I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said, shaking his finger at the
other. &ldquo;Arthur isn&rsquo;t so anxious as all that
to see anyone suffering. He only wants to
know that everything is all right; just as your
mother would go over the house again and
again when expecting company. While we&rsquo;re
ready to take care of any emergency case that
comes along, I&rsquo;m sure all of us would be just
as well satisfied if there didn&rsquo;t happen a solitary
accident while the Fair lasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That never occurred yet, as far as I know,&rdquo;
declared Billy; &ldquo;and there have been some
years when as many as a dozen people got
hurt. One man last season had a nasty fall
with a race horse on top of him, and they took
him to the hospital with both legs broken. I
could string off half a dozen cases that I plainly
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The coming of a party of visitors, curious
to see what the scouts were doing at the two
tents, broke up the conversation. For quite
some time all of them were busily engaged
showing them facts connected with camp life;
explaining how they made an excellent cooking
fire by using stones for a foundation; proving
that the ancient hunter&rsquo;s way of baking a
fowl by shutting it up over night in a hole in
the ground previously made very hot was the
original &ldquo;fireless cooker,&rdquo; and many other
interesting things.</p>
<p>All the time each scout was doing everything
he could to prove what a great benefit the
organization to which he belonged had turned
out to be for the boys of America. They made
many converts among the men, and also a few
among the women, who confessed that up to
this time they had been laboring under a false
conception as to what the scout movement
stood for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can plainly see,&rdquo; said Arthur to the scout
master, after some of these greatly interested
people had passed on, shaking hands heartily
with the boys as they thanked them for their
courtesy, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;ll be another patrol of the
Oakvale Troop between now and Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look as if we would set a few
hundred people right about the meaning of
scoutcraft and ambitions,&rdquo; admitted Hugh;
&ldquo;and for that, if nothing more, I think this
Fair camp is going to be one of the best advertisements
we could ever have run across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But while they seem to understand all about
the other things we&rsquo;ve shown them,&rdquo; Arthur
said, looking rather amused, &ldquo;I can see that
they take little stock in the usefulness of scouts
in case of accidents. They always look at each
other when I&rsquo;m modestly telling what we hope
to do for anyone that needs help, and the way
they nod shows that they accept it with a grain
of salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh, also smiling, as if to show
that it did not worry him, &ldquo;I noticed the same.
Now, I might have told those unbelievers a
few things we&rsquo;ve done, particularly about that
field hospital last summer, and when we helped
the Red Cross surgeon and nurses among the
injured strikers; but I held my tongue. It
would seem too much like blowing our own
horn to please me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; interrupted Ned Twyford,
who had come up in time to hear the burden
of their little conversation. &ldquo;If they run
across any of the Oakvale folks, and get to
sneering at the idea of boys doing temporary
surgical work, they&rsquo;re going to hear a few
plain facts that will make them sit up and take
notice, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another batch of visitors, on their way to
see the prize cattle of other fairs that were
on exhibition in the sheds not far away,
stopped to take a look around. Somehow the
sight of those tents seemed to appeal to nearly
every man; and he wanted to pick up a few
pointers, if his knowledge concerning scout
doings was hazy.</p>
<p>Now and then they found parties who believed
with all their heart and soul in the movement,
because they had seen the wonderful
change it made in certain boys&mdash;possibly of
their own family circle. It was certainly a
great pleasure for Hugh and his comrades to
chat with these friends, and give them further
information in connection with a few things
they had enjoyed or endured in the past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The afternoon was almost half over, and at
three o&rsquo;clock the racing would begin; after
which the most exciting event of the day, the
a&euml;roplane exhibition, was to be witnessed.</p>
<p>Hugh and Arthur stood by the camp, as
their duties lay in that quarter. Others of the
boys came and went as the whim seized them,
or they thought of some way in which they
could make themselves particularly useful.</p>
<p>Several crying children had already been restored
to their almost distracted parents or
guardians, since there was a squad of scouts
detailed for this purpose. Two unruly horses
had been taken in hand before they got fairly
started at running away, when the passing
band suddenly began to play some lively air.
Strangers without number had been supplied
with information, or taken from one part of
the grounds to another. It would really be
difficult to enumerate one-quarter of the methods
by which the scouts filled in their time.
They were almost constantly on the move, flitting
here and there, stopping to answer questions,
and being looked upon as real necessities,
so that the sight of a khaki uniform was presently
hailed as a sure means for dissipating
doubt and perplexity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>About this time Billy Worth made his appearance
again at headquarters, for he had
been scurrying around taking a look at the
various attractions, from the building devoted
to women&rsquo;s home work, to the fat hogs and the
fancy fowls.</p>
<p>Possibly Billy had also strayed into the
amusement zone, where there were a few concessions
allowed to showmen, with various
tents in which freaks held forth; for Billy had
a weakness in the way of such things. The
smart patter of fakirs who had Brazilian diamonds
or patent kindling wood for sale interested
him, and whenever one of this type of
gentry came to town of a Saturday night, to
hold forth on some street corner under a blazing
gasoline torch, Billy Worth could be
counted on to make one of the spellbound
audience.</p>
<p>Billy always explained that he was &ldquo;taking
stock of human nature,&rdquo; and that those glib-tongued
spell-binders were worth studying.</p>
<p>He now came up to Hugh with a decided
frown visible on his round face. It was an
unusual thing for good-natured Billy to appear
discontented, or even serious for that matter;
so that Hugh immediately asked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Billy? Something gone
wrong, or are you bothering because supper
time is so far off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, gee! it isn&rsquo;t anything that concerns me,
Hugh,&rdquo; the other replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then has anything happened to one of our
crowd?&rdquo; continued the scout master, a little
vein of anxiety in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, I&rsquo;m only bothered about a boy I
happened to run across,&rdquo; explained Billy, evidently
determined to make a clean breast of it,
and take Hugh into his confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of boy do you mean, and what
has he been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see he seems to be connected with
one of those fakirs they&rsquo;ve allowed to sell their
wares in the grounds. This chap is a slick-looking
article with the blackest eyes you ever
saw, and such a queer light in them, too.
Every time I felt them fixed on me it gave me
the most awful feeling I ever knew. He saw
me talking with Cale and must have guessed
that he was starting to tell me how he wanted
to break away from the fakir, but just couldn&rsquo;t
do it nohow. All at once Cale broke off in
what he was saying, his voice drawled as if he
was going to sleep, and would you believe it,
he just turned his back on me and walked
straight up to that fellow, who spoke to him
fiercely in a low tone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds interesting, anyway, Billy,&rdquo;
remarked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; asserted Billy, with sudden
vigor in his voice, &ldquo;that sneaky fakir has got
some unnatural influence over that boy, so as
to make him do whatever he wants. I don&rsquo;t
know much about it, but Hugh I honestly believe
he&rsquo;s hypnotized Cale!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE FAKIR AND HIS DUPE.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh Hardin elevated his eyebrows at hearing
Billy say this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take very much stock in anything
of that sort, Billy,&rdquo; he went on to remark,
&ldquo;though of course I know that one strong mind
can gain more or less control over a weaker
one, so as to make the other obey his will.
But hypnotism is going further than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Billy, &ldquo;you just wander
around that way with me as if we wanted to
look the freaks over, or listen to the patter of
the fakirs who&rsquo;re selling patent medicine and
such things to the crowd, as well as telling
them funny stories to keep them in good
humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you up on that in a minute,&rdquo; said
the scout master, &ldquo;when Alec Sands comes
along, for I see him heading this way right
now. I can leave the camp in his charge, you
know, while we walk around for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Hugh, be careful not to stare at that
man too hard,&rdquo; urged Billy. &ldquo;Gee! but he has
got the most piercing black eyes you ever saw
in your life. They seem to go right through
you, and cause a shiver as if somebody had
doused a bucket of ice-water all over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh laughed at the vivid description given,
and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is such a thing as being hypnotized,
Billy, you&rsquo;re in a fair way to find yourself
obeying the superior will of that owner of
the piercing black eyes, and keeping poor Cale
company. How did you happen to run across
the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I couldn&rsquo;t help noticing how he seemed
to be under the thumb of that man,&rdquo; Billy explained.
&ldquo;You see, he&rsquo;s useful to the fakir as
a stool pigeon. When sales get slack it&rsquo;s the
business of the boy to hold up a dollar bill,
and ask for a bottle of the wonderful remedy,
and say it cured his grandmother of every
ailment under the sun. Then he goes away,
and gets rid of the bottle, to bob up again later
on, watching for his cue to break in again with
a purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the game, is it, as old as the hills;
and yet I suppose the rubes never catch on to
it,&rdquo; remarked Hugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at the
management of this Fair allowing such frauds
to exhibit here, and sell their stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;re mad about it already, but you
see they went and made contracts so they have
to stick it out; but the like will never happen
at Oakvale again, I&rsquo;m telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me about the boy Cale,&rdquo; urged
Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I guess he was attracted by my khaki
suit, for we got to chatting over on one side
of the moving crowd. He told me his name
was Cale, but nothing more than that. He
acted so queer that I began to take notice, because,
you see, I like to study human nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we all know that, Billy; but go on,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;He would look in the direction of that
man on the soap box every minute or so while
I was explaining some of the things scouts
enjoy, for he had asked me to tell him about
that. Every time he would give a start, and
draw a long breath. I saw something ailed
him, and after a while I asked him plainly
what made him go around to fairs and harvest
homes with a fakir like that? He turned as
white as anything, and looked at me as if it
was on the tip of his tongue to say that he&rsquo;d
gone and hitched up with the man, and couldn&rsquo;t
break away. Then it happened, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he felt the influence of those
black eyes, and suddenly left you without an
explanation?&rdquo; demanded the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All he muttered as he moved away was
something that sounded to me like this: &lsquo;Wisht
I could tell you, but I just <i>can&rsquo;t</i>; he won&rsquo;t let
me; I have to do what he wants me to. If you
could only break&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and that was all I
caught, for he had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh rubbed his chin reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be more about this than appears
on the surface,&rdquo; he told Billy, much to the
gratification of that worthy. &ldquo;Perhaps it may
pay us to take an interest in this Cale. There
are lots of ways in which other fellows can be
helped, and if he&rsquo;s held tight in the clutches of
a bad man, the sooner we get some people
interested in him the better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Hugh; I&rsquo;m tickled to have
you say that. But here&rsquo;s Alec, so now suppose
you browse around a little with me while he
stands guard at the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the Otters was only too pleased
to be given this temporary responsibility, and
so the others sauntered off.</p>
<p>They did not head directly toward the
amusement zone, for that might excite the
suspicion of the fakir, did he happen to see
them making for his stand. By degrees, however,
the two scouts approached the spot, apparently
interested in the pratter of the spell-binders
in front of the several tents containing
freaks and curiosities.</p>
<p>Although the races were going on, and
crowds had gathered to witness the horses run,
there was so large a throng present at the opening
of the Fair that clusters of people were
to be met at every turn. Such an outpouring
had never before been known on the first day,
thanks to the sagacious advertising of the
affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can see the fakir, Hugh, if you
just look over to the left,&rdquo; remarked Billy, after
a bit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>At the time they were apparently interested
in another fraud who was amusing his audience
with side-splitting stories, and reaping a
harvest of quarters in return for a fountain
pen that may have been worth as much as a
dime.</p>
<p>Billy himself kept from facing that way, and
he also warned the other not to appear to look
too hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him, don&rsquo;t you, Hugh?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;What do you think of the animal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s a slick article, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, with
a glib tongue, and a way of convincing people
they must have the stuff he has to dispose of.
I can hear him talking, and as you say he&rsquo;s no
ordinary fakir. At this distance I don&rsquo;t feel
any effect of those magnetic black eyes you
talked so much about. Where&rsquo;s the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a little further to the right and you&rsquo;ll
see Cale,&rdquo; pursued Billy, who had himself discovered
these things with a hasty survey.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s leaning against that post, and kicking
his toe into the earth while waiting for his cue
to push in and buy another bottle of the magic
compound that cures all ills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see him now, and he certainly does
look pretty dejected,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
sort of slinking air about him too, as if he
might be ashamed of what he&rsquo;s compelled to
do, but can&rsquo;t help himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was saying, Hugh,&rdquo; declared
Billy, eagerly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sort of weak by nature,
and has made some terrible mistake in the past
that cuts him to the heart. He might be all
right if only we could get him away from that
slick fakir who&rsquo;s using him as his tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll think it over, Billy,&rdquo; said the
scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean nothing could be done right
away, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to hurry,&rdquo; he was told.
&ldquo;They mean to stay here until the Fair closes
Saturday night, because their best harvest will
come later on, when people from further out
in the country get here. By to-morrow we may
have settled on some sort of plan how to offer
the poor fellow a helping hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy, who always wanted to rush things,
gave a big sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s all right if you say so,
Hugh,&rdquo; he remarked, resignedly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
willing to wait until to-morrow, or even Friday,
to act; but I hope it isn&rsquo;t put off any longer
than that, for something might happen to make
him clear out. One of the poor deluded sillies
who bought a bottle of medicine might take
too much and die; and then the authorities
would arrest him for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the solicitation of Billy, the scout master
walked off by himself, presently joining the
group around the glib-tongued bogus &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo;
and listening to what he was saying. He even
saw the stool pigeon push through the gathering
to demand a bottle of the wonderful
cure-all that had so lengthened the days of his
respected grandfather that they were unwilling
to keep house without its magical presence.</p>
<p>Hugh studied the boy when he had the
chance. He realized that Billy had about hit
the mark when he described him as one who
appeared to have a rather weak nature, easily
controlled by a stronger will. Cale&rsquo;s manner
was anything but pleasing; still Hugh did not
believe the boy was really vicious or depraved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he ought to be helped to break his
associations with that clever scamp,&rdquo; was what
the scout master was deciding in his mind as
he watched the ancient game of confidence
being played upon the curious throng, with a
subsequent purchase by several who had been
hesitating, and only waiting for someone else
to break the ice, so they could hand up their
dollar without being too prominent.</p>
<p>He even managed to follow the boy as he
hurried off, and saw how he circled around,
dodging through the crowds and finally bringing
up at a tent into which he ducked. When
he came out immediately afterwards he no
longer carried the paper wrapped bottle of
medicine. Hugh did not need to see the sign
&ldquo;Old Doctor Merritt&rdquo; fastened to the dingy
canvas to understand that this was the temporary
sleeping quarters of the fakir, and also
of his helper, who deposited all his pretended
purchases back in stock.</p>
<p>Hugh went back to the scouts&rsquo; camp, thinking
what a shame it was that, for the sake of
the small amount of money paid over by these
mountebanks and fakirs, the management of
the County Fair had sold them the privilege of
fleecing the confiding visitors who came from
distances, under the belief that Oakvale would
protect her guests against all such cheating
games as these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never happen again, if the scouts can
put our people wise to such a debasing side
show sort of business,&rdquo; Hugh told the others,
when they were talking things over at the
camp during a temporary lull in the rush of
visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been able to do a few things that
count in the long run,&rdquo; said Alec. &ldquo;If future
fairs can be conducted without so much of
this rowdy sort of selling concessions to fake
shows and fakirs with claptrap humbugs to
stick the gullible public with, it would be a
feather in our caps, I&rsquo;m telling you, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here then was one thing they could concentrate
their efforts on that gave promise of
paying for the investment of capital and labor.
The idea pleased the boys the more it was discussed;
and Hugh asked those who were present
to push it wherever they had a chance.
This was to be in their homes or on the street,
until the management of the Fair must feel it
their duty to make a statement to the effect
that this was the very last occasion when
any of these objectionable elements would be
admitted to the grounds, or even allowed outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Hugh, Arthur and Lige Corbley chanced to
be standing there in front of the camp talking
with another batch of curious visitors, who
wanted to be shown everything connected with
scout life under canvas, when there was a sudden
loud outcry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A runaway!&rdquo; shouted Lige, as he pushed
his way out of the circle of people, for he was a
fellow quick to act.</p>
<p>They were just in time to see a vehicle coming
dashing along, drawn by a very much excited
pair of horses that must have taken fright
at some unusually noisy motorcar. Even as
the boys looked one of the two men in the rig
sprang out, taking his chances. The other was
vainly endeavoring to saw the two frantic animals
into subjection by pulling at the lines.</p>
<p>He might have succeeded in this, but unfortunately
one of the reins broke. Lige was
on hand, however, and, clutching hold of the
bits close to the mouth of the near horse, he
managed to detain the struggling pair until
others could come to his assistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>It was quite exciting while it lasted, and
Hugh felt glad that Big Lige had been the one
to stop the runaway. The latter shrugged his
shoulders when Hugh tried to compliment him,
and said it &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t amount to a row of beans,
in fact was almost too easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a crowd coming this way, and as
sure as you live they&rsquo;re carrying the man who
made that fool jump out of the vehicle!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dale Evans, who had arrived at the
camp just in time to see this thrilling runaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, Arthur,&rdquo; said Hugh,
turning on the other with a smile, &ldquo;there comes
your first patient!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A CREDIT TO THE UNIFORM.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if he might be hurt pretty bad,
too,&rdquo; said Billy Worth, as the crowd pressed
forward, and approached the twin tents of the
scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First thing we have to do is to keep them
back as well as we can,&rdquo; declared Hugh.
&ldquo;Whip that rope around the stakes, boys, and
then stand guard over the opening you leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout master had prepared for just such
an emergency as this. He knew that in case of
a serious accident, if the patient were brought
to the camp, a morbid curiosity to see what was
going on was apt to bring an enormous mob
surging around the tents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>That is one of the most serious difficulties
to be encountered whenever there happens to
be an accident in the public streets of a city;
and so fiercely do men, women and boys struggle
to see what is going on that they often
have to be entreated to fall back in order that
the patient may get air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him right in this tent,&rdquo; said Hugh to
the men who were carrying the man, who was
groaning with pain; and then turning to the
pressing crowd the scout master continued:
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t push so hard. The tent is open,
and some of you can see what is going on.
Keep back, and give us a chance to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That appeal awoke the spirit of fair play.
Immediately one man called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, give the boys a chance to show what
they can do! Everybody keep back, and stop
that rough house business. Here, help me hold
&rsquo;em, Crowther; give the scouts a show for their
money. Get back, do you hear; what d&rsquo;ye want
to push like that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He used energetic measures for enforcing
his demands; and as he happened to be a big
brawny man those who had been squeezing forward
so as to gain a view of the proceedings
ceased their efforts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Hugh was satisfied. He saw they had gained
friends among the watchers, and that the danger
of the tent being almost torn from its moorings
by the press of the rude crowd was a thing
of the past.</p>
<p>Accordingly he turned and joined Arthur,
who was already bending over the groaning
man with professional eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad is it, do you think, Arthur?&rdquo; asked
Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but he seems to have a broken
arm, and one of his ankles has been sprained,
for it&rsquo;s swelling fast,&rdquo; replied Arthur, who had
apparently made a surprisingly quick examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty bad combination,&rdquo; remarked
Hugh. &ldquo;Here, Dale, you and Billy get that
shoe off in a hurry, but don&rsquo;t be any rougher
than you can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Hugh started to assist Arthur.
The man had been laid on the cot with
which the hospital tent was supplied. They
lifted his head and shoulders a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and stand it the best you can, sir,&rdquo; said
Hugh, endeavoring to give the suffering man
confidence. &ldquo;We want to draw your coat off,
and then cut the sleeve of your shirt so we can
get at the injured arm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Now had it been a bearded doctor who said
this the man might have bolstered up his courage,
and stopped giving utterance to his anguish;
but when he saw that the speaker was
only a boy he shut his eyes and groaned again.</p>
<p>The coat came off, and then Arthur deftly
cut the sleeve of the man&rsquo;s shirt. He had no
sooner rolled this up out of the way before
they saw that the fracture was a pretty serious
one, coming above the wrist, and apparently
being of a compound nature.</p>
<p>Arthur did not hesitate. He seemed to have
the instincts of a true surgeon in his nature, for
grasping the injured arm he made a few deft
movements with his strong nimble fingers, and
then taking the splints which Hugh had picked
up from the little chest in which they kept their
medical supplies he began binding these to the
arm with swift, certain strokes.</p>
<p>Those in the crowd who were able to watch
the operation were astonished by the business-like
way in which Arthur and Hugh went about
it all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other boys had removed shoe
and sock and rolled up the leg of the man&rsquo;s
trousers. His ankle was swollen, and beginning
to turn a dark blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get the tin basin and pour cold water over
the ankle to keep the swelling down all you can,
Dale,&rdquo; said the scout master, giving one glance
that way.</p>
<p>Dale was already doing this, for he knew
that with a sprain the application of ice or cold
water is the first remedy to be considered. At
the best such an injury is a serious thing, and
often takes months to fully heal. Many persons
have declared they would prefer to have a
clean break of a bone than a bad sprain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean to tell me them boys know anything
about fixin&rsquo; up a broken bone?&rdquo; one man
was heard to say, with an expression of scorn in
his voice. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d think it was a man&rsquo;s
work, an&rsquo; a skillful surgeon&rsquo;s at that, to set a
bone. In my mind it&rsquo;s an outrage to let boys
meddle with serious things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, neighbor,&rdquo; said the big man who
had stood there as a bulwark, keeping the jostling,
thoughtless, curious crowd back by main
force, &ldquo;where have you been the last year or
so? I reckon all the Rip Van Winkles ain&rsquo;t
done away with yet. Wake up, and get
&rsquo;quainted with what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on these days.
Kids ain&rsquo;t just the same as when you and me
was young; they&rsquo;re shamin&rsquo; a whole lot of us
old codgers by the way they do a heap of
things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; asserted the other, doggedly,
&ldquo;but when it comes to meddlin&rsquo; with
broken bones I say it&rsquo;s a surgeon&rsquo;s job, and no
boy should be allowed to put his finger in the
pie. Why, like as not he&rsquo;ll make that arm
crooked for life. What can these here scouts
know about surgery, tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole lot, as you&rsquo;ll learn if you take the
scales off your eyes and look into what they&rsquo;ve
already done. These very scouts here have
saved some of their comrades from drowning.
They likewise took care of those strikers that
were shot down last summer when they had
that fight with the guards over at the cement
works; yes, and the Red Cross surgeon wrote
our paper here that they did their work like
veterans. If I ever have the bad luck to get
thrown out of a buggy and have <i>my</i> leg broke
I&rsquo;ll be tickled to death if some of these scouts
happen along and take hold of <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>These words were greeted with a cheer by
the crowd, for many local people were now
present, and surely they ought to know what
Hugh and his comrades of Oakvale Troop
were capable of accomplishing.</p>
<p>The skeptic may not have been wholly convinced
that the boys were capable of doing the
things that as a rule needed the skilled hand of
a surgeon; but at least he had the good sense to
keep still. That vociferous cheer may have
told him that those around had faith in the
scouts.</p>
<p>He continued to watch every move that was
made, and no doubt the confident manner in
which all the boys went about their several
tasks began to have its effect on his disbelief.
They certainly were showing all the signs of
knowing what they were about, and that stood
for a good deal.</p>
<p>The man had stopped groaning now. He
even brightened up, for after the bones had
been brought together in their proper places,
the pain was not quite so intense. Then again
the way in which Arthur and Hugh were binding
up his arm, after fixing the splints in place,
may have had something to do with the return
of his grit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the extent of the damage, boys?&rdquo; he
asked, weakly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;A broken arm, and a sprained ankle, sir,&rdquo;
said Hugh, cheerily; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re in great luck
not to have a broken neck in the bargain. We&rsquo;ll
have you fixed up so you can be moved. I guess
you don&rsquo;t live in Oakvale, sir, for you&rsquo;re a
stranger to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live some ten miles off toward Somerville;
but after that accident I&rsquo;d hate to ride behind
horses again while crippled like this,&rdquo; said the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need, sir,&rdquo; Hugh told him. &ldquo;If you say
the word we&rsquo;ll send for the ambulance and you
can go to the hospital; or if you prefer we can
get a car to take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better go to the hospital,&rdquo; the
wounded man said. &ldquo;My wife, she died last
spring, and I&rsquo;ve only got an old man and his
wife working on the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned the scout master.
&ldquo;Dale, will you call up the hospital and tell
them to come and get a patient with a broken
arm and a sprained ankle? Billy, wrap some
soft linen around that sprain now, and soak
it with the liniment. Then get another bandage
around it, and we&rsquo;ll loan him a cane. It so happens
that he can use the arm he needs to support
him when he limps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Dale hurried away, and quickly got the town
hospital on the wire. When he came back presently
he nodded to Hugh. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re on the
way by now, I reckon,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>The man had put his uninjured arm through
a sleeve of his coat, and the garment was then
fastened so that it might not fall off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to say that you boys have done
a right good job tinkering with me,&rdquo; he said,
as they helped him sit up on the cot, and Dale
procured the heavy cane that was lying handy.
&ldquo;After this I&rsquo;m going to take more interest in
the scout doings than I&rsquo;ve done in the past.
If being a scout can make boys think, and act
like this, there must be a heap of good about the
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can just depend on it there is, Mr. Benson,&rdquo;
said the big guard, who seemed to know
the injured man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked into the game,
and let me tell you it&rsquo;s going to pay a thousand
per cent. for every effort put into it by the
long-headed gentlemen who have the movement
in charge. Ten and twenty years from
now there&rsquo;s going to be a heap better class of
men around than you meet to-day; and all on
account of these scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>A few minutes later and there was heard the
sound of a gong, and up came the Red Cross
ambulance. The injured man was easily helped
into the vehicle, while Arthur and Hugh explained
to the young surgeon just what steps
they had taken to relieve suffering, and render
first aid to the injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have done better,&rdquo; said the
medical man, patting Arthur on the shoulder,
for he knew both lads well, and also understood
the design of one of them to some day
become a surgeon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know later
what I think of the way you fixed up his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ambulance went off presently, with the
man waving his one well arm back at the crowd,
and particularly toward the boys who had performed
their part so well in the tragic happening
of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Slowly the crowd dispersed, and the scouts
could find time to put things to rights again.
Arthur was looking as pleased as though he
were &ldquo;a child with a new toy,&rdquo; Billy remarked
to Hugh, under his breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The big man lingered. He was plainly greatly
interested in the boys, and asked a great
many questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man you helped,&rdquo; he told Hugh, &ldquo;was
a Silas Benson, who lives over toward Somerville.
He&rsquo;s one of the richest men in those
parts, though folks call him close. But since
his wife died I reckon there&rsquo;s a change coming
over Silas; and somehow I kind of think what&rsquo;s
happened to him to-day may set him to figuring
that he might as well get busy living for somebody
besides himself. You&rsquo;re going to hear
from him again, boy, mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did, later on, when the rich farmer
had recovered from his injuries. He wanted
them to accept a reward, but was shown that
scouts are not allowed to receive pay for their
services; and in the end Mr. Benson was easily
influenced to do something for the needs of the
orphan asylum of Oakvale, which was overcrowded,
and required a new wing built.</p>
<p>Some time after the excitement had subsided
Walter Osborne, who had been busy in another
part of the Fair grounds, came to the
camp, and Hugh could see by the look on his
face he had something on his mind that was
giving him more or less concern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queerest thing how it gives me the
slip!&rdquo; Walter was muttering when he came up
to where the scout master was standing, watching
the crowd drift past, and often waving his
hand at some boy, or group of high school girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Walter; have you lost anything?&rdquo;
asked Hugh, laying a hand on the arm
of the leader of the Hawk Patrol, of whom he
was very fond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be getting along in my dotage, Hugh,
when I can&rsquo;t remember where I met a fellow,
even when his face seems so familiar to me,&rdquo;
the other went on to say, with a frown on his
usually placid brow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t such a queer thing,&rdquo; Hugh
assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it happen to me more
than once. It always bothers me, and I get
no peace till I&rsquo;ve figured it out. I&rsquo;ve even lain
awake a night going over the alphabet from
A to Z, and then failing to get it. In the morning
the name would come to my mind just as
easy as falling off a log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that may be the way with me,&rdquo; said
Walter. &ldquo;I stood and watched that boy move
around, and half a dozen times it seemed as
though it must be on the tip of my tongue to
say his name, yet I slipped connections. A little
thing like that makes me mad. I tell you I&rsquo;ll
find out just who he is, if in the end I have to
go up and ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if you pointed him out to me, I
might help you,&rdquo; suggested Hugh, knowing
how set in his way Walter could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do that all right, Hugh,&rdquo; replied the
other scout. &ldquo;Come to think of it he&rsquo;s acting
as if he mightn&rsquo;t be engaged in the nicest kind
of business going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about that?&rdquo; demanded Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;from what I saw it
struck me he must be connected with one of
those fakirs who are trying to skin the simple
country people of their dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh arched his eyebrows, remembering
what Billy had told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember whether the man he was
working with was a fake doctor who has a
medicine he calls the Wonderful New Life
Remedy at a dollar a bottle, worth ten to any
one? Is he a man with a black pointed beard,
and eyes that glitter like you&rsquo;ve seen a badger&rsquo;s
or a snake&rsquo;s do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter uttered an exclamation of wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I declare, Hugh, you&rsquo;ve hit the right
fakir to a dot,&rdquo; he told the scout master. &ldquo;Perhaps
you&rsquo;ve even noticed that boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; Hugh remarked. &ldquo;Billy
called my attention to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, did Billy seem to think he&rsquo;d met him
somewhere, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he did say he believed the boy was
under some sort of queer spell, for he acted as
if he&rsquo;d like to break away from that fake doctor,
but didn&rsquo;t dare try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say, Hugh?&rdquo; remarked Walter.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t seem to notice anything like that. But
I&rsquo;d give a heap just to remember where it was
I ever met that boy before. I can&rsquo;t seem to
place him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Billy said he called himself Cale,&rdquo; observed
Hugh; but Walter, after thinking it over for a
brief period of time, shook his head in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem to help me any, Hugh,&rdquo;
he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ever remember of knowing any
one named Cale or Caleb, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there was a Cale Warner I used to
go with long ago, but then he had red hair and
blue eyes, while this boy is as dark as a gypsy.
Don&rsquo;t seem able to scare up another Cale. Perhaps
I never knew his name at all. Perhaps
I only happened to meet him somewhere. But
where was it, that&rsquo;s the question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help you, Walter, because I
know how it galls you to keep reaching out
and almost getting it, and then feeling that
you&rsquo;re left. But it&rsquo;ll come to you all of a sudden,
see if it doesn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll find yourself saying
his name, or remembering where you met
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if it could have been that
time we earned these bronze medals we&rsquo;re wearing
right now?&rdquo; suggested Walter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when we had the chance to help
the wounded strikers,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Well, it
may have been, but I&rsquo;m sure I never set eyes
on that boy before to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what this game makes me
think of, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners&rsquo; base, with the fellow you thought
to grab slipping right out of your hands?&rdquo; suggested
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of something else,&rdquo; resumed
Walter; &ldquo;you know when you&rsquo;re in the marsh
at a certain time of year, and the night&rsquo;s dark,
often you&rsquo;ll discover a queer light that dances
just ahead of you. When you stretch out your
hand and think to take hold, it disappears, only
to bob up again somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what you mean, Walter,&rdquo; admitted
Hugh. &ldquo;They call it a Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp,
or a jack-o&rsquo;-lantern, and tell us it&rsquo;s caused by
some kind of phosphoric condition of the atmosphere.
Standing on the deck of a moving
steamboat and looking down into the water I&rsquo;ve
seen streaks like that shoot away as fish fled
from the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just the way this name keeps
on eluding me,&rdquo; Walter confessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Something came up then to call for Hugh&rsquo;s
attention, and the subject was dropped; but
when Walter walked away later on, heading
once more toward the amusement reservation,
where the fakirs also held forth, his face looked
unusually serious, as though he could not get
that puzzle out of his mind.</p>
<p>The boys were called on to attend several
more cases of necessity during the balance of
that first afternoon. Fortunately none of these
proved to be of a serious nature, however.</p>
<p>One elderly woman fainted, and was speedily
brought to her senses with the help of a
sprinkling of cold water, and some ammonia
held under her nostrils. A boy had his finger
cut by handling something he had no business
to touch, and they brought him, crying, to the
emergency tent, where Arthur soon stopped
the bleeding, and did the finger up in such a
neat way that even the kid was soon smiling
through his tears.</p>
<p>The a&euml;roplane exhibition had passed off successfully,
and as usual it gave considerable satisfaction,
because everybody was showing great
interest in the modern methods of harnessing
the air currents to the use of mankind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>It was now getting on toward closing time,
which had been placed at sharp six o&rsquo;clock
every evening. County fairs as a rule do not
pretend to keep open nights, as they are mostly
outdoor shows, and the means for illuminating
the exhibits would be found sadly lacking.</p>
<p>By degrees the scouts were gathering in their
camps, and making preparations looking to going
home to a good hot supper. Most of the
boys were furiously hungry, for it had been a
long afternoon, and they had certainly covered
a good deal of territory in carrying out their
plan of campaign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we meet here again to-morrow
afternoon, as soon as we can get a bite of lunch
at home?&rdquo; remarked Spike Welling, brushing
his leggings free from dust, for Spike had been
one of the most industrious guides on the
grounds ever since arriving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s understood without any further orders,&rdquo;
Hugh told him. &ldquo;The programme we
laid out for to-day will carry over to-morrow
as well. I want to say to you now that every
fellow has done himself and the troop proud
by his work to-day. I&rsquo;m sure the people of
Oakvale appreciate what we&rsquo;ve tried to do for
the success of the County Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes President Truesdale, Hugh,&rdquo;
interrupted Alec Sands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I bet you he&rsquo;s heading this way to give
us the glad hand, too,&rdquo; added Billy, immediately
beginning to swell out his ample chest as
though in anticipation of the bouquets that
would soon be passing around.</p>
<p>The head man of the Association, as he drew
near, was pleased to see the scouts line up like
magic, and give him the proper salute. Evidently
he had been hearing pretty favorable reports
of their doings, because there was a smile
on his face as he surveyed that double khaki-clad
line of bright eager faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, boys,&rdquo; the President said,
warmly, as he acknowledged this salute in his
honor by a wave of his hand. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave
the grounds this evening until I had come over
here to your camp to tell you how well satisfied
we all are with the great help you have
given the management in carrying out their arduous
duties. I&rsquo;ve heard great reports of you
in a dozen different ways. If this Fair is a
success beyond any previous exhibition, part
of the credit will justly fall to the Oakvale
Troop of Boy Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Billy Worth, and three
lusty cheers were given with a will.</p>
<p>Hugh never knew what impelled him to say
what he did. Perhaps the matter was on his
mind, and somehow he just felt that the opportunity
was too good to be entirely lost. He was
afterward rather surprised at his own audacity;
but then the President happened to be a
congenial gentleman who felt warmly toward
the wearers of the khaki, so Hugh decided to
&ldquo;strike while the iron is hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very much obliged to you for saying
what you have, sir,&rdquo; Hugh spoke up. &ldquo;It
makes us feel proud to know that what little
we&rsquo;ve done pleases you. If you will excuse me
for being so bold, I&rsquo;d like to say that there&rsquo;s
only one thing wrong with the whole Fair, as
we see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might that be, my boy?&rdquo; asked the
gentleman, raising his eyebrows as if rather
taken aback at hearing Hugh speak so fearlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about those fakirs, and some of the side-show
humbugs, sir,&rdquo; continued the scout master,
while his chums held their breath in mingled
admiration. &ldquo;They are a disgrace to Oakvale.
They are here to deceive the public, and
take as much money away as they can, using all
sorts of deception. We&rsquo;ve been told that next
year it&rsquo;s going to be different, and we all hope
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman stood there and eyed Hugh
under his heavy brows. They could not exactly
tell whether he might feel angry at being
spoken to so boldly, or only amused. Hugh
himself was beginning to suspect that he may
have done an unwise thing, and offended the
President. His fears, however, proved groundless,
for presently the other spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with every word you have said,
Hugh. It was a great mistake to bind ourselves
by contract to allow these disgraces this
year. All of my colleagues realize it now, and
take my word for it, nothing like it will ever
happen again. We know it is necessary to have
some way of amusing the majority of people
who attend these fairs; but we&rsquo;ll find a way
to do that without allowing them to be fleeced
by a gang of legalized robbers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; called Billy again, just as though
he had been made cheer captain for the whole
troop. Nearly a score of lusty young voices
rang out once, twice, three times in unison.</p>
<p>Some of the retiring people hurrying toward
the gates, at hearing the vociferous cheers,
glanced that way, and seeing the scouts, smiled;
for in nearly every quarter Hugh and his comrades
had won golden opinions on account of
their universal desire to be of assistance, with
their unfailing courtesy toward strangers, as
well as to those whom they knew.</p>
<p>So the President of the Association went
away with a last happy nod toward the khaki
boys. Having laced both tents securely so that
their goods might be reasonably safe, Hugh led
his troop out of the grounds in regular marching
order, with the flag and the bugler in front,
and the others following two abreast.</p>
<p>As they were separating, Walter managed to
whisper to the scout master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to knock my head to-night and
see if I can&rsquo;t just remember where it was I
met that boy; tell you how I got on when I see
you to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">SOWING THE SEED.</span></h2>
<p>The second day of the County Fair promised
to show even a greater attendance than
the opening one had done. Of course, the
really fine weather had considerable to do with
the success of the undertaking, for it would
be hard to imagine a more complete failure
than such an exhibition always proves when
an unfortunate rainy spell comes along just after
it had started.</p>
<p>Once again did the scouts appear in full numbers,
eager to undertake another afternoon&rsquo;s
work. At home and abroad, as well as in the
school-room, they had been hearing nothing but
encouraging words, and were thus primed for
excelling their previous record.</p>
<p>Walter Osborne saw the scout master looking
at him with a quizzical smile on his face,
as soon as he arrived at the camp. He shook
his head rather dolefully in the negative.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;That name gets on my nerves, for a fact,
Hugh!&rdquo; the Hawk leader confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, after all, you didn&rsquo;t dream the answer
last night, or have it pop into your head
the first thing this morning?&rdquo; asked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old story,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d open
my mouth to say where I had met that boy,
and then get no further. I mean to keep an
eye on him part of the afternoon. Perhaps I
may glimpse some little way he has about him
that will freshen up this silly old memory of
mine. A fine scout I&rsquo;m turning out to be when
I can&rsquo;t remember a little thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t bother your head too much about
it,&rdquo; Hugh advised him; &ldquo;that is, I hope you
won&rsquo;t let it interfere with your duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can promise you that, Hugh. My folks
had word from Uncle Reuben and Aunt Ruth
this morning. They hope to land in Oakvale on
that six-twenty train this evening, so I expect
to go right down from here and meet them in
time for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;ll be here for the last two days
of the Fair,&rdquo; remarked Hugh, &ldquo;for it certainly
will be worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>He soon had his various detachments at
work. Some were sent to the station to meet
the next train; others wandered about the
grounds, and into the various buildings where
all manner of exhibits of great interest to the
farmer and the housewife were being admired
by thousands of visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether we&rsquo;ll have any serious
cases to-day?&rdquo; remarked Arthur Cameron, as
he joined Hugh, and looking around expectantly
as he spoke at the passing throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be hoped not,&rdquo; the other replied. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t seem so anxious if I were you, Arthur.
If they come we&rsquo;ll try our best to take
care of them; but all the same we shouldn&rsquo;t allow
ourselves to wish for anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way, Hugh,&rdquo; exclaimed
Arthur, turning red with confusion;
&ldquo;though a fellow begins to have a professional
curiosity concerning the character of his next
job. That was so easy what we had yesterday,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; remarked Hugh. &ldquo;Well, all the
people who spoke to me about it seemed to
think the other way. Several said they admired
the nerve you showed; and one old lady
even went so far as to tell me&mdash;now don&rsquo;t get
proud, Arthur&mdash;that you were a born surgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Arthur drew in a long breath. That praise
did him more good than anything he had ever
heard; for he meant to be a surgeon; and nothing
must be allowed to stand in the way of
his following whither inclination and destiny
beckoned.</p>
<p>Again there were scores of visitors attracted
by the trim camp, and the sight of the manly
looking boys in scout uniforms. They stopped
to ask questions, and were shown the complete
camping arrangements, all of which interested
them. Hugh could not but notice that a look
of doubt and skepticism crossed many of the
faces of these strangers when they heard that
the second tent was to be used as an emergency
hospital, and that the boys stood ready to perform
any needed surgical operation as covered
by the rules of &ldquo;first aid to the injured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The good people could readily understand
how boys might camp out, take care of themselves
in the woods if lost, and engage in various
games connected with life in the open&mdash;such
as reading signs left by small wild animals,
or following the trail of a comrade&mdash;but
they were unwilling to believe the boys could
actually save human life by prompt attendance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have a little pamphlet to hand
out to these Doubting Thomases, according to
my way of thinking,&rdquo; said Don Miller, the
leader of the Fox Patrol, after a party of rustics
had gone on, smiling, and exchanging nods
after hearing of that useful tent&rsquo;s part in the
arrangements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;that even
then they&rsquo;d think we were blowing our own
horns a little. The only thing that convinces
some people is a practical demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, our folks know we can do what we
claim, so what&rsquo;s the use bothering about what
these other people think?&rdquo; said Buck Winter,
who had happened along in time to overhear
this little talk.</p>
<p>In the very next lot of visitors Hugh saw a
boy who was all eyes and ears for the different
devices looking to giving the scouts comfort
when in camp. Apparently the lad was wild to
join a troop, but his father had a sour look on
his face that would seem to indicate he did not
approve of such a thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sow a few seeds there that may
take root and grow,&rdquo; Hugh told himself, and
immediately he took great pains to explain a
dozen different ways whereby scouts are bound
to become better boys at home on account of
the training they receive when in company of
their mates.</p>
<p>After he had managed to interest the man
he began telling him of a number of instances
he could vouch for where backward boys had
been aroused from their condition of seeming
torpor, and surprised their parents by the new
spirit with which they took hold of things.</p>
<p>All the while the boy was tugging at the coat
of his father, and every jerk he gave when
Hugh made some likely assertion seemed to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, didn&rsquo;t I tell you so, dad? What do
you think of that? If other fellows can do it
why don&rsquo;t you give me a chance to try and
see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The man began to ask questions. He also
looked at his boy as though debating the matter
with himself, for it was hard to change his
mind, when he had been running down this
Boy Scout movement the way he had. Still,
Hugh had appealed to him in a manner that
was almost irresistible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good notion to make the venture,&rdquo;
he said to Hugh, presently; &ldquo;his maw&rsquo;s been
plaguing me nearly to death to let Johnny jine,
but somehow I had an idea it was a fool thing,
and he&rsquo;d only waste his time. You see he&rsquo;s
not as bright as he might be; and since you&rsquo;ve
been telling me about other boys that woke up,
it sot me to thinking perhaps Johnny might get
some good out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh would never forget the look on the
boy&rsquo;s face as he heard his father make this
confession. He was so utterly overwhelmed
with joy that he hardly seemed to breathe as he
looked first at Hugh and then at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are ten to one,&rdquo; said the scout
master, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll never regret it if you decide
to let him come in. Do you live anywhere
near Oakvale, sir; I don&rsquo;t remember meeting
you before?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Wheeler, and I&rsquo;ve bought the
old Lyons farm about three miles out,&rdquo; the
other explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing a whole
lot about the scouts, and what big things
they&rsquo;ve been doing over there at the cement
works riot, and so on. Course it seemed impossible
to me, but since coming to the Fair I&rsquo;ve
struck an old friend who said he helped keep
back the crowd yesterday when you boys took
care of the man that was hurt in that runaway
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you must mean Mr. Jones,&rdquo; said Hugh,
mentioning the name the big man had given
him before taking his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the one. Somehow, after I&rsquo;d
heard him tell a few things I began to feel sort
of different toward you scouts. I had to own
up to myself that I was prejudiced, and hadn&rsquo;t
been fair to you. Now, I come in on Saturday
afternoons, and could fetch Johnny along with
me, picking him up about ten o&rsquo;clock when I
passed by on the way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! dad!&rdquo; gasped the delighted Johnny;
while Hugh gave him a sunny look and a handshake
that meant everything to the boy whose
one longing seemed to be to see himself one
of the scouts whom he had admired so long
from a distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Hugh never allowed a chance to slip past
when he could say a good word for the advancement
of the cause. He knew that thousands
of boys would be eager to wear the khaki
and start on the upward climb if it were not
for the decided opposition they experienced at
home. According to Hugh&rsquo;s viewpoint that
was the very place where they should be receiving
the most encouragement.</p>
<p>If parents, instead of blindly denouncing any
movement like this, would only candidly examine
it, see what it has done for other boys in
their own town, and then decide the question
on its merits, thousands of additions would be
made to the scout ranks.</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on there were several
cases requiring first aid. They happened
to all be of a minor character, though Arthur
gave them his best attention, for he believed in
doing everything well. One boy was taken
with a bad case of cramps, and howled dismally
until &ldquo;Old Doc Cameron,&rdquo; as Billy had nicknamed
Arthur, succeeded in relieving the griping
pain by the use of some remedy he always
carried in the medicine chest. Boys, when out
in camp, are apt to be reckless in their manner
of eating, and devour green apples or any other
fruit calculated to double them up with <i>cholera
morbus</i>. Then some remedy that contains camphor
and pepper is needed to warm the stomach,
and counteract the effects of the dangerous
food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Arthur did manage to have one rather difficult
operation later on. A man came limping
over to the tent, claiming that he had made a
bad stroke with an axe he was wielding and
managed to cut his foot. On examination the
hurt proved to be a serious one; but Arthur
washed the foot, cleansed the wound perfectly,
so that all danger of blood poisoning was avoided,
and after binding it up properly, the man
was sent to his home in a car offered by an
accommodating visitor (who had been an interested
spectator of the whole operation).</p>
<p>He had just gone off when Hugh discovered
Billy coming up. It dawned on him that Billy
had kept himself aloof from the camp ever since
they opened their headquarters that afternoon,
though he must have been doing scout work
elsewhere, for Billy was not the one to shirk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Hugh noticed that the stout chum looked excited,
and while there was really no reason for
connecting this fact with what they had talked
about on the preceding afternoon, the scout
master found himself remembering the cause
of their conversation on that same occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been up to something, Billy, if looks
count,&rdquo; Hugh told him as the other came up,
panting a little from hurrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that you could hardly
call it that, Hugh,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;I own up I&rsquo;ve
been keeping an eye on that medicine fakir and
Cale, because I like to study human nature, you
remember, and that pair certainly make a fellow
sit up and take notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new in that quarter?&rdquo; asked
Hugh, carelessly, to draw the other out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I hurried here to tell you, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then there have been developments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the queer influence that slick fakir
Old Doctor Merritt has been exercising over
that chap Cale must be weakening around now,
Hugh. How do I know? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you.
As I passed close to their medicine tent I heard
a loud voice. It was the fake doctor threatening
violence to the boy if he didn&rsquo;t keep on doing
his part to victimize the public. Hugh,
I believe Cale is trying to break away; and I
tell you&mdash;it&rsquo;s about time we stepped in to take a
hand in the game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">A SCOUT IN TROUBLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited about it, Billy,&rdquo; said
Hugh, in his soothing way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and keep cool, Hugh,&rdquo; came the reply;
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s something about the looks and
ways of that fake doctor that makes my blood
boil. He couldn&rsquo;t drag me around like he does
that Cale; but, then, everybody isn&rsquo;t alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;d have a pretty hefty job hauling
you around with him,&rdquo; assented Hugh, with a
chuckle, as he surveyed the stout figure of his
chum. &ldquo;Speaking of our interfering&mdash;it
mustn&rsquo;t be done hastily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that it might get Dr. Merritt
wild?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make a bitter enemy out of him,
which stands for the same thing,&rdquo; Hugh said,
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I miss my guess, Hugh, if you refuse to
lend that poor boy a helping hand when he
needs it the worst kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scouts seldom do that, you know, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a weak chap, but he&rsquo;s nerved up to
make a try for freedom, whatever the kind of
bonds that are holding him may be,&rdquo; Billy ventured
to say, as though he had been figuring the
whole case out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that sounds encouraging,&rdquo; Hugh told
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find a chance to say a single word
to him when next I saw him hovering around
the stand where they sell that stuff. He happened
to see me, and gave me a nod. Hugh,
there was the most mournful look on his face
you ever saw. Gee! it&rsquo;ll sure haunt me for ever
so long if we let this game go right along under
our eyes, and don&rsquo;t help Cale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, Billy, make up your mind
in the start that we <i>will</i> help him!&rdquo; the scout
master declared, firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed the stout
boy, wringing the hand of the leader of the
Wolf Patrol. &ldquo;When I hear you say that I
know the thing&rsquo;s as good as done! Looking
back, I can&rsquo;t remember a single time when we
failed to win out after you decided to lead the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;No blarney, now, Billy,&rdquo; warned the other,
shaking his head and smiling. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our
hands full trying to figure this thing out. And
from what I&rsquo;ve seen of that man I should say
first of all that he has a violent temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you heard the way he stormed at the boy
inside that tent you&rsquo;d believe it easy enough!&rdquo;
declared Billy. &ldquo;Why, he must have had the
poor fellow trembling like anything for fear
he would be knocked down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, supposing you devote the rest of this
afternoon to watching your chance to talk with
Cale,&rdquo; suggested the scout master.</p>
<p>Billy considered this for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, presently. &ldquo;I can
fix that easy enough. What ought I do if I get
the chance; how shall I talk to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and find out just what sort of a hold the
fakir has on him,&rdquo; advised Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean ask what he&rsquo;s ever done to be so
tight in the grip of such a bad man; is that the
idea, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other scout, &ldquo;because if
there was nothing except his fear of the man
you&rsquo;d think he would have run away long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Hugh, you&rsquo;re forgetting what I said
before?&rdquo; urged Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean about there being some sort of
hypnotism which the &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; exerts over Cale
so as to make it impossible for him to break
his bonds; is that what you&rsquo;re referring to,
Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as sure of it, Hugh, as that my name is
Billy Worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said the scout master, &ldquo;even if
we let it go at that, you must tell Cale he&rsquo;s got
the backing of the scouts, and that we&rsquo;re bound
to see him through. Unless he&rsquo;s done something
terrible, which the man is holding over
his head, there&rsquo;s no reason why he should keep
on being a slave in this free country of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Hugh,&rdquo; vowed Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
trot along and see if I can give him the wink to
let him know I&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to have a little chin
with him. Depend on me to fix it, if only he
shows he&rsquo;s got the nerve to meet me half way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you luck, Billy!&rdquo; the scout leader told
him, as the stout boy hastened away, bent upon
his errand of kindness; for good-hearted Billy
Worth was never so happy as when doing
something for others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Another influx of eager and curious visitors
at this moment took Hugh&rsquo;s attention from the
affair of the medicine fakir and his dupe. Once
more the scout master was called upon to explain
some of the duties and rewards that came
the way of the wearers of the khaki. That he
did his work well could be told in the satisfied
remarks made by the groups of visitors as they
departed for other fields.</p>
<p>It was a rare pleasure for Hugh to sow the
good seed in this fashion. His heart was in
the work, for he believed in the mission of the
Boy Scouts to lift American lads to a higher
plane of usefulness, and to a better way of living.</p>
<p>That must have been a record crowd for
Oakvale County Fair, and the oldest inhabitant
was heard to declare he had never before seen
anything like the outpouring of people from
near and from far who attended.</p>
<p>They were everywhere throughout the spacious
enclosed grounds given over to the Exhibition
of products of the soil, the orchard, the
dairy, the hennery, and in fact representing
every part of country life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>While the grandstand at the racetrack was
packed, and crowds loitered along the fence
enclosing the quarter-mile circuit to witness the
a&euml;roplane ascent, with its wonderful evolutions,
proving the mastery of the pilot over his craft,
there was no lack of people in other sections.</p>
<p>They came and went at the camp of the
scouts. Hugh had talked so much he was actually
feeling hoarse; but as another hour or
so would wind up the show for that day he was
bent on sticking to his task to the end.</p>
<p>Arthur helped out, for it happened that there
had been no call for his services in the emergency
tent. Now and then Hugh would cast a
speculative glance over toward the quarter
where the amusement zone was located. Doubtless
he was wondering why Billy did not show
up with some sort of report connected with the
boy whom they were desirous of helping.</p>
<p>Still, there would be two more days of the
Fair, and if the chance to do something failed
to arrive on Thursday, perhaps it would come
along on Friday, or even with Saturday. As
long as the harvest was there, and could be
reaped so easily, it seemed to Hugh there would
be little danger of Doc Merritt packing up his
stand and clearing out between two days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only danger of that,&rdquo; mused Hugh,
&ldquo;would be if he was doing such a land-office
business there as to sell his entire supply of
stuff out, and have to close shop on that account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even then he could hardly believe so fertile
a brain as that of the fakir would fail to devise
some new means for reaping still further profits
by taking up some other device.</p>
<p>It was about this time late in the afternoon
when Hugh suddenly became aware of the fact
that there had arisen some sort of commotion
a little way off. First he thought he could hear
angry voices as though men might be quarreling,
and this gave him a bad feeling, because
so far the fair had been remarkably free from
all manner of fights, simply because liquor was
not allowed on the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be, do you think, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Arthur who asked this question, showing
that he, too, had not only caught the loud
sounds, but was equally mystified in trying to
place them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Other voices joined in with the first ones.
Shouts were even heard and then came the
yelping of a dog as some man stepped on its
tail, or else gave the animal a hearty kick after
being almost tripped by having it get under his
feet.</p>
<p>Harold Tremaine, who was a comparatively
recent addition to the troop, and still looked
upon as a tenderfoot, chanced to be at the camp
when this furore broke out. Having an especial
antipathy for dogs&mdash;for a reason that was
connected with a bad scare he had once experienced
when a small chap&mdash;Harold seized hold
of Hugh&rsquo;s sleeve and hastily asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t believe it could be a dog gone
mad, do you, Hugh? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be terrible
if such a thing as that happened, with all this
crowd here, and so many women and children,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your mind easy, Harold,&rdquo; said the
other, without the slightest hesitation, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
a mad dog scare, I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
Harold, apparently not so certain in his own
mind, and wishing to be reassured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it was that,&rdquo; said the scout master,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;d hear men and boys shouting <i>mad dog</i>
at the top of their voices. With that cry, there
never was a time when people kept on flocking
<i>toward</i> the scene, you know that, Harold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, Hugh, certainly it is!&rdquo; declared
the other, in a relieved tone. &ldquo;Every
lasting one of them would run the other way
as if he were crazy. As you say, they&rsquo;re pushing
up now toward the place where all that
loud talking is coming from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me they&rsquo;re beginning to move this
way, too,&rdquo; remarked Arthur. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s so,
we&rsquo;ll soon find out what all the trouble is
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh saw this for himself. He wondered
whether the excitement could have any connection
with Billy Worth&rsquo;s mission regarding
the breaking of the strange ties between the
medicine fakir and Cale.</p>
<p>This idea flashed into his head when he fancied
he saw a boy dressed in khaki in the midst
of the throng, apparently dodging about, as
though he might be concerned in the row. Before
Hugh could be sure as to his identity the
crowd had once more swallowed him up; but it
gave the scout master a little spell of uneasiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>He found himself imagining all sorts of wild
things. Possibly Billy, in his earnest desire to
help the boy who was an unwilling assistant in
the schemes of Old Doc Merritt, had gone beyond
the bounds of prudence; perhaps he had
even put himself in danger of being arrested on
some charge formulated by the fakir!</p>
<p>Hugh had almost decided to start straight
for the scene of confusion, so as to learn the
worst, when all of a sudden the tenor of the
cries changed. They were now of a more angry
nature, such as a reckless mob would utter
when chasing after some hapless fugitive.</p>
<p>Looking more closely, Hugh saw a figure
burst into view. Many hands tried in vain to
seize upon the fleeing boy, but with wonderful
agility he seemed to avoid them all, and came
madly racing and dodging toward the camp of
the scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, looky there, Hugh!&rdquo; cried Arthur, in
surprise, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s one of our scouts, as sure as you
live! Andy Wallis at that! I wonder what
under the sun it all means, and what he can
have been doing now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Hugh felt a cold hand rest upon his heart.
Andy Wallis was one of the later additions
to the troop. He had once been a crony of the
reformed Lige Corbley; and while nothing had
happened to indicate that the boy had not really
turned over a new leaf, at the same time Hugh
was not absolutely sure about him.</p>
<p>Andy was undoubtedly fearfully worked up.
He did not mean that any one should prevent
him from reaching the shelter of the scouts&rsquo;
camp, though what sort of a haven that would
prove for him was a question yet to be decided.</p>
<p>The crowd chased after him. Many loud
cries were heard and Hugh shivered when he
caught some of them, for they sounded like
&ldquo;stop the thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the frightened Andy managed to reach
the spot where the scout master stood. He
threw himself down, and clasped Hugh around
the legs, as he cried shrilly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them take me, Hugh! That little
man says I stole his pocketbook, but I give you
the word of a scout that I&rsquo;d sooner die than
do a thing like that. You won&rsquo;t let them arrest
me, will you, Hugh? My father will throw me
out if they do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE RIFT IN THE CLOUD.</span></h2>
<p>When Hugh heard this he knew he had a
pretty difficult proposition on his hands. There
was Andy cowering at his feet, and beseeching
him to save him. Close by stood an excited little
man who was evidently very angry besides,
and in a frame of mind to prefer charges
against the accused lad. The crowd that gathered
around did not look any too friendly, for
a thief is held in low esteem in a country town.</p>
<p>First of all, Hugh knew that it was his duty
to stand up for a fellow scout as long as his
guilt had not been proved. There were always
chances for mistakes being made; and Andy
was denying it so frantically that he could not
believe the boy guilty of degrading his uniform
by stealing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s telling you a downright lie!&rdquo; cried the
little man shaking his finger threateningly at
the boy. &ldquo;He was right at my heels when I
discovered that someone had taken my pocketbook.
When I accused him of it he looked
frightened and tried to run. I tell you he is the
culprit, and I want him arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take things a little more coolly, sir,&rdquo; advised
Hugh. &ldquo;Nothing is to be gained by being
excited. The boy isn&rsquo;t going to run away.
It&rsquo;s a serious thing to make such an accusation
without being sure of what you say. Did you
have much money in your pocketbook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of three hundred dollars, in new bills I
just got from the bank,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in the chicken business, and meant to buy some
fancy blue-ribbon stock while at the Fair. But
I was wise enough to mark every one of those
ten-dollar bills with a couple of little red
crosses. I&rsquo;d know them again if I saw them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Hennery Cooper!&rdquo; called out
someone in the crowd. &ldquo;That was what I&rsquo;d
call a smart dodge. Your chickens will come
home to roost yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, what have you got to say about this
accusation?&rdquo; asked Hugh, as he helped to bring
the trembling and white-faced boy to his feet
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;All I can say, Hugh,&rdquo; the other replied, with
quivering lip, &ldquo;is that I never did such a thing.
Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t take his pocketbook for anything.
I know I&rsquo;ve got a bad reputation to live
down, but I&rsquo;ve been trying hard to do it. He
just turned on me, and accused me. It scared
me, and I tried to run before I even thought
how bad that would look. But, Hugh, I give
you my word as a scout that I&rsquo;m innocent. You
believe me, don&rsquo;t you, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh still faced the angry man who claimed
to have been robbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I can see, sir,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
only accused this boy on general principles.
Because he looked frightened when you told
him so, and tried to run, you say he is guilty.
Now you will have to show better evidence than
that in court. Did you see him take your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, er, no, I don&rsquo;t say that exactly; but
I&rsquo;m sure he did!&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a good many persons who, if suddenly
accused, would be so alarmed that they
might lose their heads and run away. Listen
to what I&rsquo;m going to propose to you, Mr.
Cooper, if that&rsquo;s your name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go ahead, then,&rdquo; said the other,
turning to nod to the crowd as if he wanted
to be sure of keeping this backing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he took your pocketbook,&rdquo; continued the
scout master, &ldquo;and you discovered your loss so
quickly that he had not left your side, the
chances are he&rsquo;d have it on his person, don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it,&rdquo; assented the other, cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, would you be satisfied to have his
pockets searched by some person present who
would act fair and square to both parties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds all right, Hennery!&rdquo; called out
someone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take him up on that offer,
Cooper!&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Major Anson here to do the searching;
we all know him like a book!&rdquo; a third man advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m agreeable!&rdquo; admitted the loser of
the missing property.</p>
<p>Hugh turned to Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to let Major Anson look
through your pockets, Andy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I am, Hugh, and I&rsquo;ll be only to glad of
it, because I know right well he won&rsquo;t find anything
on me. I&rsquo;d be a fool to do such a mean
thing when I&rsquo;m wearing a scout&rsquo;s uniform. I&rsquo;d
jump in Rainbow Lake first. Do you think I&rsquo;ve
forgotten that my dad told me if I ever went
back to my old ways again he&rsquo;d kick me out of
the house? Let him search me and welcome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Anson was a veteran of the Civil
War. He delighted to wear his beloved blue
uniform, and his slouch hat with its gold-threaded
cord. Everybody knew him, and had
the greatest respect for his honesty. He now
stepped forward, for like most men the old fellow
liked to find himself in the limelight once
in a while.</p>
<p>Andy raised both arms as though wishing
to make the searching operation as easy for the
veteran as he could. Hugh noticed that in
place of the frightened expression on his face
there was now a little smile of utmost confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is surely innocent!&rdquo; Hugh was saying to
himself as he saw this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The pressing crowd gaped and watched.
Perhaps some of them, remembering that in
the past this same Andy Wallis has not enjoyed
a very good reputation, may have indulged
in the expectation that the boy might
not be so innocent as he claimed.</p>
<p>All at once Major Anson held something up
which he had just taken from one of the scout&rsquo;s
outer coat pockets. Hugh gave a gasp of dismay,
for he saw that it was a pocketbook!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your property, sir?&rdquo; demanded the
veteran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; almost shouted the
little man, as he snatched the article from the
other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my pocketbook as sure as anything;
but see here, it doesn&rsquo;t hold a single one
of those thirty ten-dollar bills I told you about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the crowd. Every eye
seemed to be focussed upon the face of the
wretched Andy, again white as chalk. He was
staring hard at the pocketbook as though it
might be an accusing finger pointed straight at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never took it!&rdquo; Andy cried, almost choking
with emotion. &ldquo;I say I never saw it before
this minute. Somebody must have put it in my
pocket if you found it there. Oh, Hugh, don&rsquo;t
turn your head away from me; you&rsquo;re all I&rsquo;ve
got to back me up! <i>You</i> believe me, say you
do, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Hugh would have given a great deal to have
felt absolutely sure concerning the boy&rsquo;s innocence.
The evidence seemed so strong, added
to the past reputation of Andy, that he had to
grit his teeth and with a great effort make up
his mind to do all he could to solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on searching, Major Anson, please,&rdquo;
he told the veteran. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found the husk,
but without the kernel. See if you can discover
a single one of those marked ten-dollar bills on
the boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again did Andy allow his person to be gone
over, though he was so weak from fear that
he would have fallen had not Hugh put an arm
about his shoulders. It was the contact with
the scout master that held Andy up in that
minute of anguish. In such a time the personal
touch of a friend&rsquo;s hand is worth more
than can be reckoned in money; for it gives
confidence, and announces that not quite all the
world has turned against the unfortunate one.</p>
<p>Old Major Anson did his part of the business
thoroughly. He examined every pocket,
and even ran his hand over the lining of the
boy&rsquo;s khaki coat as though he suspected some
secret hiding-place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>When he had completed his task the veteran
nodded to Hugh, and made a salute as one officer
might to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in the way of money on his
person, sir,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<p>The crowd had waited eagerly, and seemed
to anticipate further thrilling disclosures. To
most of those who looked on, it was pretty
much in the way of a source of amusement;
some of them were hoping the wad of stolen
bills would be found. It mattered little to them
that a boy&rsquo;s heart was perilously near the
breaking point; he was only a boy, and they
also remembered that he had once been a rogue
under the tutelage of Lige Corbley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said the owner of the
empty pocketbook, &ldquo;he must have handed the
money over to a confederate. These slick rascals
always hunt in pairs, I&rsquo;m told. Just as
soon as he got my property he slipped the bills
out and passed them onto some one who walked
away while we were making all that row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds kind of reasonable to me!&rdquo; said one
man, frowning at the shivering Andy, against
whom he may have had a spite of long standing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look up at me, Andy!&rdquo; said Hugh, sternly,
and the boy obeyed quickly, with an expression
on his pallid face that Hugh somehow could
only compare to the look of a hunted deer that
finds its escape cut off, and the savage wolves
closing in on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Hugh?&rdquo; he asked, piteously,
wringing his hands as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still tell me on your word of honor as a
scout that you never touched that pocketbook,
and never saw it before, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep on saying it as long as I have a
breath in my body!&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;If they
torture me I&rsquo;ll never change my mind, because
I didn&rsquo;t take it! I want you to believe I&rsquo;m trying
to live up to a scout&rsquo;s vows, Hugh, sure I
am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, firmly, &ldquo;I do believe you,
Andy. I&rsquo;m going to stand by you through
thick and thin, at least until they can show
more proof than just the finding of an empty
pocketbook in your coat would seem to be. The
thief might have slipped it in <i>my</i> pocket just as
easily; but that&rsquo;s no reason people should say <i>I</i>
stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows and trusts you, Hugh,&rdquo;
called out a man; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s different with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hugh instantly told him, with flashing
eyes, &ldquo;it is different with him, for he&rsquo;s got
a past to live down, and I honestly believe he&rsquo;s
doing it right well. For shame, that you&rsquo;d be
all the more ready to believe him guilty than
any other boy. I&rsquo;ve taken the trouble to test
him more than once, and he proved faithful to
his trust. We&rsquo;re bound to believe him innocent
until he&rsquo;s absolutely proved guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s hand closed convulsively on Hugh&rsquo;s
arm when he heard him say that. No matter
what might come to him in after life he would
never forget how the scout master stood back
of him in this, his hour of peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the Chief,&rdquo; said a man; &ldquo;and
he&rsquo;s the boy&rsquo;s uncle, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same he&rsquo;s got to take him in if I prefer
a charge against him, I want you to know!&rdquo;
cried the robbed poultry dealer, angrily. &ldquo;He
won&rsquo;t get off easy because his uncle happens to
be at the head of the Oakvale police force.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of the Chief not doing his duty,&rdquo;
he was informed; &ldquo;he knows his play, and if it
was his own boy he&rsquo;d run him in without a
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I happen to know the Chief used to be
mighty sore about this nephew of his when
the boy was running with that Corbley gang,
and painting the town red,&rdquo; another man sang
out.</p>
<p>Hugh was in a quandary. If the little man
insisted, the arrest must be made. Aside from
the inconvenience it might cause poor Andy
there was the disgrace attached to having a boy
dressed in the khaki of a scout taken up on
the Fair grounds on the charge of being a
thief!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; said the boy, trying to brace up, &ldquo;no
matter what they say or do I want you to know
I&rsquo;m innocent, and that I&rsquo;d sooner cut my hand
off than do such a thing after I&rsquo;ve been getting
on so finely. That&rsquo;s all I can say,&rdquo; and he
heaved a mighty sigh as though resigning himself
to the inevitable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>They tell us that it is always darkest just
before dawn, and Hugh had cause to remember
this later on. He thought he was feeling
about as badly as any one could, and hardly
knew which way to turn as the pompous-looking
Chief of Police could be seen hurrying
toward the spot.</p>
<p>Just then a hearty voice rang out, and somehow
it seemed to instantly give Hugh a feeling
of greatest relief, even before he caught the
tenor of what was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept quiet long enough,&rdquo; said this
party. &ldquo;I wanted to see just how far this
thing would go. That boy is innocent, because
I saw the man drop that pocketbook in his coat.
You know me, I guess. Jones is my name, and
it&rsquo;s never been questioned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">ONE BOY&rsquo;S INFLUENCE.</span></h2>
<p>Yes, it was their friend of the other day, Mr.
Jones, the same who had helped keep back
the crowd at the time Arthur was working over
the man injured in the runaway accident.</p>
<p>Again he had bobbed up just at the critical
moment. On hearing the splendid news he
brought, Hugh felt like giving a shout of joy.
As for poor, badgered Andy, his mouth opened,
and his eyes grew luminous with tears, but for
the life of him he could not give utterance to
the mingled emotions that filled his heart.</p>
<p>The little man who had been robbed was not
going to give up quite so easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if you saw someone drop this empty
bill-folder in his pocket, sir, that doesn&rsquo;t prove
him innocent. Would you know the thief again
if you saw him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones grinned, for he seemed to be
greatly amused over something or other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m sure I would,&rdquo; he replied, positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, if you saw him do what he did,
you must have guessed he&rsquo;d emptied the
pocketbook before he got rid of it!&rdquo; blurted the
victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have cut my eye-teeth, let me tell you, my
bantam,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones; and the crowd
laughed as it was recalled that the other had
confessed to being a poultry dealer, so that the
application seemed very pat. &ldquo;I recognized
the game immediately. Once &rsquo;on a time I
found <i>three</i> empty pocketbooks on my own person
after being in a crush in the city, where
pickpockets were as busy as bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you do something to have
the rascal apprehended, may I ask?&rdquo; demanded
the other indignantly. &ldquo;If you saw all you say,
and let the thief walk away, you become a party
to the crime after the fact, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Softly now, my bantam, no names if you
please,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones, without displaying any
annoyance. &ldquo;One of the reasons why I was
late in arriving on the scene here lay in the fact
that I <i>did</i> consider it my duty to keep track
of that slick rascal, and see where he went. I
followed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps, sir, you can take us to where
he may be found; unless, in the meantime, he&rsquo;s
managed to leave the Fair grounds?&rdquo; continued
the victim; naturally eager to recover his lost
funds, if it were possible.</p>
<p>Again did Mr. Jones give that odd little
chuckle of his. Hugh began to believe the big
friendly man must have a card up his sleeve
which he meant to play when it suited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be pleased to have you accompany
me,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones, &ldquo;and particularly the
Chief here and these Boy Scouts who have been
so gallantly standing up for one of their number
unjustly accused. Listen, my friend: I
followed the thief to the building in which there
have been built a number of closets intended
for the clothes of the men who were working
on the grounds before the Fair opened. He
entered one of these, to conceal his ill-gotten
plunder, I reckon. Well, I just closed the door,
and put a fine big section of joist against it in
such a way that mortal man couldn&rsquo;t push it
aside. Unless someone has let him out, we&rsquo;ll
find him still there. Come along, everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>There was an immediate rush on the part of
the crowd; the Chief striding on ahead with
Mr. Jones, the man who had lost his money,
and a cluster of the Boy Scouts, including
Hugh, Arthur, and the delighted Andy, following
closely.</p>
<p>As they entered the building referred to,
Hugh saw with considerable pleasure that there
was a stout section of joist leaning against one
of the closet doors. Striding forward, they
soon filled that end of the building, with more
late comers trying to push in, so that they
might see what it was all about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ready for him, Chief,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones,
&ldquo;because he may be a desperate case.&rdquo; The big
officer produced his gun, and stood there in a
position to immediately cage the thief as soon
as the door was thrown open.</p>
<p>When Mr. Jones cast down the strip of timber
that had been so deftly braced against the
closed door so as to make it immovable, out
walked a man. He was trying to appear as unconcerned
as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this row mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;I found my light overcoat a burden and was
meaning to hang it in here and take the key
with me when some prank-playing boy shut me
in. I shall complain to the management of the
Fair about such treatment to visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search him, and see if he has the money on
his person!&rdquo; ordered the Chief, who had been
put in touch with the nature of the offense.</p>
<p>The man threatened all sorts of things in retaliation
for such an &ldquo;insult,&rdquo; but in spite of
his words Mr. Jones went through all his pockets.
There was no result so far as disclosing
any sign of the lost bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him there while I investigate inside,&rdquo;
said the big man. &ldquo;On finding himself trapped,
it would be his policy to hide the stuff somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He vanished inside the clothes closet and was
heard scratching a number of matches in order
to have light. Presently he came out again.
The crowd gave a shout as Mr. Jones held up
a package of what seemed to be brand-new
bank bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if that is your money, sir!&rdquo; he told the
excited poultry dealer, as he thrust the roll into
his hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, for here are the little red crosses
I made, just as I told you!&rdquo; exclaimed the other,
in rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count them!&rdquo; continued the big man, as
though invested with authority.</p>
<p>Having done this the other announced the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All here, the whole thirty bills; but although
I&rsquo;ve recovered my property I mean to press the
charge of robbery against this scamp. Chief,
lock him up, and I&rsquo;ll be at the hearing, I give
you my word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caught thief only laughed jeeringly as
though he might not be very much alarmed concerning
country justice. As the Chief led him
away, after actually snapping handcuffs on his
wrists, he even turned and called back a few
remarks intended to inform the poultryman
that he had been the easiest &ldquo;picking&rdquo; he had
ever known.</p>
<p>There was a jumble of voices as the crowd
pushed out of the building, every one trying to
keep pace with Hugh and the other scouts, as
well as with Mr. Jones and the man who had
luckily recovered his money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Mr. Cooper, if that&rsquo;s your name,&rdquo;
said the big man, suddenly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to
apologize to this boy here for accusing him of
taking your cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll do that quick enough,&rdquo; said the
little man, who was feeling the reaction that
followed the recovery of his property. &ldquo;See
here, I&rsquo;ll make amends for being a little hard
on him by giving him one of these fine new
ten-dollar bills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held it out to Andy Wallis. Hugh
watched to see what would happen, for he saw
the boy&rsquo;s chest heaving convulsively, while his
eyes, in which tears had so recently stood, now
flashed ominously.</p>
<p>Snatching the bill from the extended hand
of the poultry dealer, Andy flung it scornfully
to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take back your money!&rdquo; he said, bitterly.
&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d touch it after what you&rsquo;ve
been saying about me? Not if you offered me
the whole roll. Next time I hope you&rsquo;ll go a
little slow about trying to put a thing like this
on a poor boy, just because he happened to be
standing near by when some one robbed you,
and got scared at being accused.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Andy; you&rsquo;re giving it to him
straight!&rdquo; called out a voice, for crowds are
as fickle as an April day, and just now every
one was believing in the reformation of Andy
Wallis, the Chief&rsquo;s nephew.</p>
<p>The boy paid no attention to those around.
He clung to Hugh, remembering that it was
the scout master who had said with a ring of
sincerity in his voice: &ldquo;I do believe in you,
Andy, and I&rsquo;m going to stand by you through
thick and thin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they could get away from the attending
throng, by entering the tent, Andy insisted
on wringing the other&rsquo;s hand again and again.
He seemed to be greatly worked up over what
had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think, Hugh, do you,&rdquo; he asked,
anxiously, &ldquo;that my dad will be mad if he hears
that I was accused of stealing that pocketbook?
He is mighty touchy about me nowadays, and
says that if I don&rsquo;t toe the chalk-line this time
for keeps, he&rsquo;ll send me away up to an old uncle
of mine who hates boys, and would make life
miserable for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take pains to see your father this
very evening, and tell him the whole thing,&rdquo;
said Hugh. &ldquo;He ought to be proud of what
you&rsquo;ve done, and I mean to let him understand
that every fellow in Oakvale Troop is pulling
for you, Andy. I know just as well as I&rsquo;m
standing here that nothing can ever make you
go back to the old life again, now that you&rsquo;ve
had a taste of what it means to have people
respect you. Make your mind easy on that
score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, you&rsquo;re the best friend I ever had,&rdquo;
said Andy, now actually breaking down and
crying like a baby, for the boy had gone
through a terrible experience, calculated to
shatter his nerves badly. &ldquo;I never would have
held out if it hadn&rsquo;t been that I knew <i>you</i> believed
in me. Now nothing on earth is going
to make me go back on my word. I&rsquo;d die sooner
than deceive a friend like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh finally got him quieted down, so that
when he had washed his face and his inflamed
eyes, Andy was in condition to step out again,
and wander off. Now that the experience was
a thing of the past, he would feel all the better
for having been tried and found not wanting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Arthur was engaged in attending to a child
that had been hurt in some trivial way, but
whose fond mother was greatly concerned. So
Hugh, stepping out once more, glanced around
to ascertain if he could see any signs of the
long-absent Billy.</p>
<p>One of the first things he set eyes on was
the well-known figure of the stout chum hastening
toward him, making signs as though he
had something of importance to communicate.</p>
<p>Apparently Billy had known nothing of what
had happened. He must have been over in the
section of the grounds laid off for amusements;
and as there were frequent outbursts of shouting
on the part of groups of fun-loving boys,
he had not been attracted by the excitement attending
the discovery of the robbery and the
accusation of Andy Wallis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come with me, Hugh,&rdquo; panted
Billy as he joined the other; &ldquo;the show will
close up for to-day in half an hour more, and
there&rsquo;s something going on over here we ought
to take a hand in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along with you, Billy,&rdquo; Hugh told
him. &ldquo;First of all, tell me, did you get a chance
to speak with the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I couldn&rsquo;t say much, because the
crowd&rsquo;s big and sales whopping, so it kept Cale
busy. Then the man looked like he could eat
me alive, every time he saw me. He must guess
we&rsquo;re on his trail, and mean to get the boy
away from his evil influence. Why, he even
shook his head at me once, and scowled just like
a pirate. He shows his white teeth when he
does that, and it makes you shiver, you just
can&rsquo;t help it, Hugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told Cale the scouts wanted to help
him, did you, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s about the size of it, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he seem to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought at first he seemed pleased; but
then that old frown came back on his face
again, and he shook his head. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to, ever
so much, tell your friends,&rsquo; he went on to say,
Hugh, and in such a wistful tone, too, it&rsquo;d have
made you feel sorry for him like it did me, if
you heard him, &lsquo;but it just can&rsquo;t be. He&rsquo;s got
me tied down fast, hand and foot. I don&rsquo;t dare
call my soul my own. When I want to turn
and run I feel something grip me that makes
me go back to him. I hate him like I would a
spider or a snake, but I ain&rsquo;t my own boss, and
I can&rsquo;t ever hope to run away from him!&rsquo;
Hugh, I told you how it was; that man has control
over his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon find that out,&rdquo; said the scout
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for there&rsquo;s Cale now, leaning against
that post again; and see how black and hopeless
his face looks, Hugh! I certainly want to
do something to help him give that man the
slip!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">BACKED BY THE SCOUTS.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop here a bit, and try to catch his
eye,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking myself that would be a good
idea,&rdquo; promptly agreed Billy, who had the
greatest possible faith in the persuasive ability
of the scout master. He felt absolutely certain
that if only Hugh could get in touch with the
badgered boy, Cale was sure to decide on breaking
away from his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Walter Osborne,&rdquo; remarked
Hugh.</p>
<p>He knew why the Hawk leader must have
been loitering around that particular part of
the Fair grounds. Walter undoubtedly was
still worrying himself almost sick over his queer
inability to place the boy who went by the name
of Cale. In order to try and freshen his memory
somewhat he had wandered over this way,
in the hope that seeing the other&rsquo;s face occasionally
might help out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>As he now came up, Hugh looked at him inquiringly.
There was such a depressed expression
on Walter&rsquo;s face that words were wholly
unnecessary to explain the utter failure that
had overwhelmed his plan of campaign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Hugh,&rdquo; he muttered in a
tone of abject disgust. &ldquo;Came near saying it
once, but got side-tracked. I never had a thing
give me half the bother that this does; but it
isn&rsquo;t my way to give up. I&rsquo;ll hit it yet, see if I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh smiled as he went on to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a little pointer, Walter, that
may help out. We&rsquo;re calling that chap Cale,
but how do we know that&rsquo;s his name? It&rsquo;s true
he told Billy here it was, but sometimes boys
that take to bad ways feel it best to adopt a
name that&rsquo;s different from the one they used to
sport. How about that, Walter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it before, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed
the other, his face lighting up; &ldquo;and
I tell you it&rsquo;s a good idea. To-night I&rsquo;m going
to run over every kind of a boy&rsquo;s name I ever
heard, and try to see if any one fits.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that you&rsquo;re here with us, Walter,&rdquo;
the scout master told him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
stay. We may need more help before we&rsquo;re
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! what&rsquo;s up, Hugh?&rdquo; demanded the
leader of the Hawks.</p>
<p>Hugh thereupon told him a few things in
connection with the boy called Cale that was
news to Walter. He showed the greatest interest
in all he heard, and was only too willing
to join forces with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t like the looks of that
medicine fakir any more than the rest of you
do,&rdquo; Walter announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a
hand in getting that boy out of his clutches.
Perhaps he&rsquo;s got a good home somewhere, and
has been tempted to run away. Right now
some old mother may be crying her eyes out
because she doesn&rsquo;t know where Cale is. Yes,
count me in, Hugh, no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time for the Fair to close, for
the sun&rsquo;s setting,&rdquo; Hugh remarked. &ldquo;So, whatever
we expect to do, we&rsquo;ll have to get busy
now. There, the boy has started off in the direction
of their tent with that last bottle of
stuff he made out to buy, so as to get the hesitating
countrymen to hand up their dollars.
This is our chance, I take it, fellows. Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>They followed after the skulking boy. Hugh
noticed that there was a certain hang-dog air
about Cale that may have come from the utter
collapse of his pride. He was evidently heartily
ashamed of his occupation as a decoy for the
fake doctor, and felt that others were eyeing
him in scorn. Still, for some secret cause he
seemed to lack the nerve to break his bonds
and give the medicine fakir the slip.</p>
<p>When Hugh and the other scouts reached the
tent with its little sign of &ldquo;Old Doc Merritt&rdquo;
the boy had vanished, but as they had seen him
pass inside, there was no question as to his
whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, as long as he can keep a dozen people
around him, and have the chance to sell another
bottle of his stuff, the fakir is apt to
stay by his stand,&rdquo; said the scout master.
&ldquo;That ought to give us five or ten minutes to
talk with Cale, and get him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time enough,&rdquo; Billy added, &ldquo;for I know
he&rsquo;ll be ready to throw himself on our hands
once you get talking to him like a Dutch uncle,
Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;There he comes out again,&rdquo; announced
Walter.</p>
<p>Hugh immediately led the way up to the boy,
who saw their approach with mingled emotions,
if his changing color several times could be
taken as any indication of his feelings.</p>
<p>He looked nervously around him. Hugh
knew his first fear was that the fakir might
happen upon them before anything was settled.
Hope was battling with his old sense of
helplessness.</p>
<p>Hugh never beat around the bush when there
was need of haste. He walked straight up to
the boy and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale, we scouts have made up our minds
that we&rsquo;ve just got to take hold of your case
and help you break away from that man,&rdquo; said
Hugh, in his positive way that usually carried
conviction with it. &ldquo;If only you&rsquo;ll say the word
we&rsquo;ll stand back of you, and get you out of this
scrape. You don&rsquo;t want to keep doing this
sort of business any longer, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate it worse than poison,&rdquo; said the boy,
almost fiercely; &ldquo;but seems as if I couldn&rsquo;t
break loose from Doc Merritt nohow. I&rsquo;ve
made up my mind to run away as many as
twenty times, but it only takes one look from
those terrible eyes of his to change everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll let us try to get you off, won&rsquo;t
you, Cale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if you only could!&rdquo; he said, plaintively.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing enough to go, but you fellows will
have to do it all, because I&rsquo;m as weak as a kitten
when he catches my eye. I have to sneeze
when he takes snuff, as they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh remembered that later on, and took
advantage of his knowledge, as will be seen
when the time comes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be willing to start home to your
folks if we bought you a railroad ticket?&rdquo; asked
the scout master, as he linked an arm with that
of the other, and started leading him away,
making sure that he went in an opposite direction
to the stand of the fakir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The boy trembled on hearing this, and Hugh
knew that his guess must have hit the mark.
There was a story back of it, which might mean
a waiting mother, a wayward boy, a yielding to
temptation, and finally his getting into the grip
of the fakir, who, for certain reasons of his
own, seemed determined that Cale should not
leave his employ, though he treated him as
meanly as any slave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s, I would be dreadfully glad to go
home again if I only had the chance,&rdquo; he faltered,
almost breaking down when he said that
one magical word &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Then, sighing heavily
again, he continued: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether
they&rsquo;d want me to come back again after the
awful thing I did. He keeps telling me they&rsquo;ve
disowned me for good. But sometimes at night,
when I get to thinking it over, I can&rsquo;t bring myself
to believe my <i>mother</i> would do that, no
matter how bad I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Cale, you can bet your mother
will stand back of you!&rdquo; burst out Billy, whose
heart was beating in sympathy for the wretched
boy. &ldquo;&rsquo;Specially if she knows you&rsquo;ve turned
over a new leaf, and mean to walk straight
after this. You tell her that the first thing,
and it&rsquo;s going to be all right, believe me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cale smiled in a wan sort of way, as he
nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;I kind of guess pretty near all mothers are
alike that way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a bad boy,
and tried to break my mother&rsquo;s heart with my
doings; but, say, I&rsquo;ve had a terrible lesson. I
don&rsquo;t pity myself one bit, because I deserved all
I got, and heaps more. But if ever I do get another
chance, I&rsquo;ll show what there is in me or
die a-trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; declared Billy, vehemently.</p>
<p>Walter could not keep from reaching out and
gripping the other&rsquo;s hand; for the time being
he had even forgotten all about the mystery
connected with Cale, in his sympathy for the
other&rsquo;s troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all over now, Cale,&rdquo; he said, as
warmly as he could. &ldquo;If you let us engineer
this thing, we&rsquo;ll see you through. When Hugh
here takes on a job he never draws back. Just
you make up your mind that you&rsquo;ve seen the
last of that man, and it ends it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he finds out that I&rsquo;ve gone, he&rsquo;ll chase after
me like hot cakes,&rdquo; said Cale uneasily, looking
over his shoulder as he spoke, as though
half fearing he might discover the black-eyed
fakir hurrying along, bent on snatching him
away from the custody of these new friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let him come,&rdquo; said Billy, as he
stooped and possessed himself of a likely looking
stick that in case of emergency might be
made to serve in the capacity of a cudgel.</p>
<p>Hugh just then gave utterance to a peculiar
sound&mdash;at least it might have seemed strange
in the ears of any one not connected with a
scout troop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How-ooo-ooo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very fair imitation of the howl of
the gray wolf. It was instantly recognized by
a couple of boys clad in khaki at the gates.
Ralph Kenyon and Jack Durham looked around
at hearing the call of the Wolf Patrol, to which
both of them belonged. Seeing their chums,
and that Hugh was beckoning to them, they
waited for the others to come up.</p>
<p>Hugh had an object in this. He was not
sure but what they were fated to have some
trouble with the fakir before they could get
the boy started on the train he would want to
take in order to reach his home. In that event
numbers would be apt to cut some figure in deterring
Doc Merritt from trying to take Cale
from them by force. Five were better than
three, especially when the additional reinforcements
were a pair of husky fellows like Jack
and Ralph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>One thing Hugh had noticed, which was that
the boy made no attempt to tell them what his
name was, or where he lived. Of course, after
he got his ticket they would be apt to learn this
fact; which Walter might consider a clue toward
lifting the veil of mystery that seemed
to cling about the identity of the other.</p>
<p>After leaving the Fair grounds, they headed
along the thoroughfare leading into the town
of Oakvale. Hundreds were going that way,
with all sorts of vehicles filling the road itself,
from fine cars to humble wagons, and even bicycles.</p>
<p>The grounds in which the yearly Exhibition
was held were some little distance from the
station. Perhaps ten minutes&rsquo; walk would be
necessary in order to take them there, for rapid
progress was out of the question on account of
the congestion of the highway.</p>
<p>Cale was plainly nervous. He walked between
Hugh and Billy, who had hold of his
arms, but every minute the boy was seen to
half look behind him, as though in imagination
he could hear the hateful voice of the fakir
ordering him to stop this foolishness and come
back to his duties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>On his part, Hugh was fully determined that
now they had started in this thing they would
fight it through to a finish. What was the use
of putting a hand to the plow unless they
went to the end of the furrow? If Doc Merritt
tried force, they would meet him half way.
Should he appeal to the law, Hugh was ready
to have all the conditions of Cale&rsquo;s servitude exposed,
no matter at what cost, and the boy separated
from his cruel oppressor, who exercised
such a strange influence over him.</p>
<p>Now they had gone two-thirds of the distance,
and having shaken off most of the crowd
by taking a side street in the town, could see the
station ahead of them.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Ralph Kenyon, always
on the alert as became one who in times
past, when he followed the profession of an
amateur trapper, had pitted his sagacity
against the cunning of small fur-bearing animals,
uttered an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody chasing after us licketty-split
in a buggy, Hugh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be at all surprised if it turned out to be that
medicine fakir, Old Doc Merritt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">AT THE STATION.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh could feel the figure of the boy partly
collapse as he muttered these disconsolate
words. He only tightened his clasp on Cale&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry a bit about it,&rdquo; he said, in the
other&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to let him put a
hand on you. Just try your level best to keep
from looking at him; and leave the rest to us.
We&rsquo;ll see you through, and let him try to take
you away if he dares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to see him try it, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
blustered Billy, swinging that nice club of his
with a &ldquo;swish&rdquo; that sounded encouraging to
him.</p>
<p>This sort of talk began to buoy up the spirits
of Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and hold out, fellows!&rdquo; he told them.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that man. He can make you
do just what he wants. It&rsquo;s simply fierce what
a way he has of changing your mind for you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;d like to see him get me to change
mine, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Billy chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here he comes, and now we&rsquo;ll see some
fun!&rdquo; declared Jack Durham, as the rapid beating
of horse&rsquo;s hoofs reached their ears, accompanied
by a man&rsquo;s angry voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop right where you are, I tell you, boy! I
want you to go back with me in this buggy!
You are under contract with me, understand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well stop and have it out with
him,&rdquo; remarked Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, since we couldn&rsquo;t expect to run away
from a horse,&rdquo; added Walter.</p>
<p>So they stepped to one side of the road, and
as the vehicle arrived the man in the buggy
stopped his sweating horse by drawing sharply
on the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, what do you boys mean trying to kidnap
my assistant?&rdquo; he shouted, shaking the
whip he held in a menacing manner.</p>
<p>Hugh stepped in front of Cale, one of his objects
being to keep the boy from meeting those
angry and glittering eyes of the fakir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you to keep that whip to yourself,
sir,&rdquo; he said, meaningly. &ldquo;If you have any
idea of trying to use it on us you had better
think twice. With the first stroke I promise
that you&rsquo;ll find it snatched from your hand, and
used on your back without mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Billy Worth, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;re
scouts, don&rsquo;t think we can&rsquo;t protect ourselves if
set on. The rules don&rsquo;t keep us from defending
ourselves from assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the man did not quite like the determined
manner of those five boys in khaki;
at any rate he stopped switching the whip in
that menacing manner, though at the same time
continuing to scowl blackly at Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you boys know you&rsquo;re liable to arrest
for trying to entice my assistant to break his
contract with me in the middle of my harvest
season? I&rsquo;ll have the law on you, and lock you
all up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy Worth laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure make us shiver with fright, Mister
Merritt, if that&rsquo;s your real name,&rdquo; he told
the other. &ldquo;Hugh, tell him to go to thunder,
and that we&rsquo;re not one mite afraid of his bluster.
Cale&rsquo;s going with us if we have to pick
him up and carry him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Perhaps Billy had a double reason for talking
in this way. He may have intended to warn
the fakir that they would resist him to the utmost;
but more than that it was of importance
that the boy should feel they were determined
to keep him from obeying the will of his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cale!&rdquo; said the man, sharply, using a peculiar
tone which doubtless was inclined to affect
the boy more than his natural voice.</p>
<p>Hugh continued to stand between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at him, Cale!&rdquo; he said, forcefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right here and get in with me, I tell
you!&rdquo; continued the man, sternly.</p>
<p>Cale made a mechanical move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go!&rdquo; he muttered, helplessly,
whereat Billy linked his arm more tightly in
his, while Walter did the same on the other
side, with Ralph and Jack pushing to the front
alongside Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much you will,&rdquo; said Billy, derisively.
&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;ve gone to all this trouble with you
to give up so easy? You&rsquo;re going to stick it
out with us, Cale, hear me talking? We won&rsquo;t
let you go worth a cent!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Start off toward the station with him, fellows,&rdquo;
said Hugh, grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stand guard
on this side of you. Keep fast hold of Cale all
the while. Once we get there I&rsquo;ll call up Chief
Wallis, and get him over to settle this thing.
He&rsquo;s a good friend of ours, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the buggy seemed hardly to know
what to do next when they started along the
street heading for the railroad station, now in
plain sight. He must have guessed that his
grip on poor Cale was broken through the persistence
of these five scouts, and yet, being a
most stubborn sort of man, he evidently did
not mean to give up until he had exhausted
every means for attaining his purposes.</p>
<p>He started up his horse so as to keep even
with them. He began to appeal to the boy to
stand by him. He used every device which in
the past had acted so favorably in forcing Cale
to obey his will; but the conditions, with those
five guardians striding alongside the weak boy,
were changed now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Billy, not wishing Cale to hear much that the
fakir said, kept up more or less of a racket. He
whistled shrilly, laughed, and even started to
sing snatches of some rollicking school song,
such as scouts were accustomed to rolling out
in concert when seated about their campfire of
nights, after their bountiful suppers.</p>
<p>In this manner they drew nearer the station.
Hugh would often look back at that last hundred
yards of the journey with amusement.
Billy was really making himself ridiculous in
his endeavor to drown the voice of Doc Merritt,
so that it might not have its intended effect on
the boy whom they had taken in charge.</p>
<p>There were a good many people waiting for
the trains, because one would draw in from
either direction presently. Hugh had already
learned that Cale wanted to go west from Oakvale;
and this meant there was no great hurry,
since that train was not due to arrive for
twenty minutes after the one for the east came
along.</p>
<p>One thing still bothered Hugh. It concerned
the future actions of Doc Merritt. If the medicine
fakir, for some reason or other, wanted
to keep hold of Cale, he might think it worth
his while to go aboard the same train as the
boy for the purpose of getting hold of him
when the scouts would no longer stand as a bulwark
between his victim and himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Just how that was to be avoided was a puzzling
question. Hugh was inclined to turn to
Chief Wallis as a means for detaining the fakir.
If they could prevent him from taking that
train, by trumping up some sort of charge that
would detain him in Oakvale an hour or so, all
might yet be well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that time the boy ought to be far on the
way home,&rdquo; Hugh told himself as he thought
it all over. &ldquo;At any rate, he will be beyond the
reach of this man&rsquo;s evil influence. Yes, that
seems to be the best thing to do. I&rsquo;ll try and
get the Chief over as soon as the train for the
east pulls out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that because even then he heard a
whistle down the track indicating the approach
of the train from the west.</p>
<p>When they reached the station, the man
jumped from his vehicle, and gave the rig in
charge of a boy to look after. He persisted in
following them as they threaded their way
through the crowds that surged this way and
that&mdash;for scores of people had come from up
and down the road to attend the Fair, and were
taking the last opportunity to get back home
at a reasonable hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The man was still trying to get in touch with
Cale, though the scouts had formed a complete
circle around the boy, and he dared not use violence.
Hugh began to suspect the fakir had in
mind just such an idea as he himself had been
considering; that is, he meant to board the same
train that bore Cale off.</p>
<p>This scheme must have struck Walter about
that time, which would account for his saying
to the scout master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, he&rsquo;s a sure-enough sticker, that man
is, and he won&rsquo;t see Cale go off on that train
without making another try to get him, mark
my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to set up a game on him, then,&rdquo;
remarked Billy. &ldquo;It would never do to let him
be in the same car as Cale. The boy would give
in as quick as anything. Hugh, how can we
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a scheme in mind,&rdquo; Hugh told him;
&ldquo;just wait until this train pulls out, and there&rsquo;s
a little more room. Then I&rsquo;ll start things moving.
We&rsquo;ll put a peg in his game. He&rsquo;ll have to
anchor in Oakvale to-night, even if we get him
locked up on a charge of assault.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I see what you mean now,&rdquo; declared
Billy. &ldquo;We are to rattle him the best we know
how till he gets peeved enough to lay that whip
on one of us. Then you&rsquo;ll have him arrested,
and held at the station house till after the train
goes. Say, that&rsquo;s a great dodge, Hugh! When
it comes to thinking up things, you&rsquo;re in a class
by yourself. Some day you&rsquo;ll be one of our
ambassadors abroad, I honestly believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coming of the train prevented any further
exchange of opinions among the five
scouts. They continued to keep Cale shut in,
preventing the man from fixing that terrible
gaze of his on the boy&rsquo;s eye. Several times the
look which the fakir gave them told that he was
angry enough to almost start to using the whip
which somehow he still kept in his hand; but
thinking better of it he wisely refrained from
active measures.</p>
<p>It might be the sight of Billy&rsquo;s swinging stick
that deterred him. Then again he may have
determined to bide his time and put into operation
a little scheme that had occurred to him
along the very lines Hugh had considered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>These boys were in their home town, while
he was a stranger there, and known as a fakir
at that. He could not count on any sympathy
in case of an open rupture at the station.
There was even a strong possibility that he
might be roughly handled in the bargain by
the gathered throng.</p>
<p>The ringing of the engine bell as the train
came into the station announced to the hurrying
crowd that it was time to get aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish this was my train,&rdquo; Hugh heard the
boy say, as though he had begun to fear the
long delay, with that man hovering so close,
bent, too, on once more regaining control over
his will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it will come along inside of
twenty minutes,&rdquo; said the scout master. &ldquo;In
the meantime we&rsquo;ll try to fix him so he can&rsquo;t
bother you. Just keep a stiff upper lip, Cale,
and everything is going to come out right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope so, I hope so!&rdquo; the anxious boy
was saying to himself, as he clasped and unclasped
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better step inside here, fellows, and let
those passengers go by,&rdquo; suggested Jack Durham
at this juncture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>A number of travelers had left the cars, and
were making their way as best they could
through the crowd, heading in the direction of
the station building further along the platform.</p>
<p>The confusion was at its height, with the engine
letting off surplus steam with a hissing
sound that prevented conversation to a great
extent. Hugh, still guarding the rescued Cale,
turned to glance at the newcomers. He supposed,
of course, that for the most part they
would be relatives of the town people, coming
to have a look at the County Fair before it
closed its gates on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>A voice at his elbow startled Hugh; it was
Walter crying out excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that must be Uncle Reuben and Aunt
Ruth! Why, I&rsquo;d almost forgotten they were
coming on this train. Hold on here! Hugh,
stop him, can&rsquo;t you; he&rsquo;s trying to break away
from us! Here, Cale, what ails you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">HOW IT TURNED OUT.</span></h2>
<p>As he turned at hearing this outburst from
Walter, Hugh saw something that surprised
him very much. Cale was no longer standing
there with bowed head, trying to keep his eyes
away from the burning gaze of the fakir. He
was staring in the direction of the oncoming
passengers who had just left the standing train,
staring as though he could hardly believe his
eyes.</p>
<p>Even as Hugh looked he saw Cale suddenly
push Walter and Billy aside as though nothing
could hold him back. Straight toward the couple
in advance he ran, then stood still in front
of them, and uttered a loud cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Hugh saw the middle-aged gentleman and
stout lady pause. The packages she was holding
fell with a crash to the platform; her two
arms were outstretched eagerly; and as the
scouts stared as though in a dream they saw the
boy folded in his mother&rsquo;s convulsive clasp,
while she rained kisses on his face, and the
man, too, looked radiant with new-found joy.</p>
<p>Walter leaned up against the scout master
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, oh, Hugh, what do you say to that?
Just to think, it was my own cousin Spencer,
after all, and I didn&rsquo;t know it. Yes, and I believe
his middle name is Caleb, too. Well! well!
well! if this isn&rsquo;t the greatest thing I ever ran
up against. There, the boy&rsquo;s pointing at Old
Doc Merritt now, and see how the fakir is trying
to sneak away, will you? He knows his
cake is all dough, doesn&rsquo;t he, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your uncle and aunt have recognized
him, Walter,&rdquo; Hugh remarked. &ldquo;From the
way they are acting, and exchanging remarks,
I wouldn&rsquo;t be much surprised if we found that
Doc Merritt had a purpose in trying to pull
your cousin down to his own low level.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>In the end it actually proved to be so. Aunt
Ruth had recognized a man who once upon a
time, many years before, had been anxious to
have her marry him, and upon being turned
down for Reuben, had taken it hard, even to
uttering threats. Chancing to meet the boy, he
soon found that he could influence him to do
his bidding; and in this way, in the end, he had
caused him to run away, under the belief that
he had done something so terrible that his folks
could never forgive him for it.</p>
<p>Hugh and Walter saw the boy beckoning to
them, and hastened to join the party, as did the
other scouts as well, all of them being greatly
elated over the way things were turning out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe it all to these fine fellows,&rdquo; the boy
was saying to his mother, as he gripped Hugh
and Billy by the hand; then he was more than
astonished to see Walter kiss his aunt, shake
hands with his uncle, telling them at the same
time who he was.</p>
<p>Cale did not look like the same boy. No
longer was that dejected, hunted expression
upon his face. Instead, his countenance fairly
glowed with happiness, for like magic all those
black clouds had been swept aside, and the sun
was beating down on him. Not only was he
freed forever from those hateful bonds of servitude
that had kept him glued to the fortunes
of the fakir, but he had been reconciled to those
parents whom he had come to fear were lost to
him forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>It was a jolly party that started to walk to
Walter&rsquo;s house. Spencer, as they must now
learn to call the boy known as Cale, clung
to Hugh and his cousin. There were many explanations
to be made, but by degrees all would
be told. Meanwhile that mother and father
were contented to know that while their boy
had been lost, he was found again; all else mattered
little to them.</p>
<p>Hugh was more than satisfied with the splendid
way in which things had turned out. When
he, Billy, Ralph and Jack started home, after
seeing the rest of the party to the Osborne
house, he expressed himself in no uncertain
tones along these lines:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if we&rsquo;d had the arrangement of things
in our own hands, boys, I don&rsquo;t see how we
could have made any improvement on that
wind-up at the station. There were the repentant
boy, the forgiving mother and father, and
the baffled plotter, all mixed up in a bunch. It
was a glorious end to our little helping-hand
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Hugh,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;I really believe
that boy will make good after the bitter experience
he&rsquo;s passed through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; declared the scout master.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a terrible lesson to him, and yet, in
the end, may have been the greatest thing that
could have happened. Bad as he&rsquo;s been treated,
he might have gone to a worse end if this thing
hadn&rsquo;t come to him. Now he will strive to show
that forgiving mother what&rsquo;s in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like shaking hands with myself just
to know I&rsquo;ve had anything at all to do with
cheating that hound of a fakir out of his prey,&rdquo;
said Jack Durham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just taking the words out of my
mouth when you say that, Jack!&rdquo; announced
Ralph Kenyon, who had been intensely interested
in trying to understand just what it was
all about; for up to the time he joined the
group at the gates of the Fair grounds, Ralph
had known nothing at all about the plans of
Hugh and Billy to save Cale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll miss the
soft, oily voice of Old Doc Merritt on the
grounds to-morrow. He&rsquo;ll never have the nerve
to stay around Oakvale after what he saw at
the station this evening. A late train to-night
will take him away, you mark my words if it
isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Sure enough, there was no medicine sold at
the Fair on the next day, or Saturday, either;
and those disappointed purchasers who may
have come back to demand the return of their
dollars because the Wonderful New Life
Remedy had failed to do what the fakir claimed
for it, had their trouble for their pains, and,
as Billy said, &ldquo;their pains also for their
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">STOPPED ON THE ROAD&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p>All the same that was not the last some of
the boys saw of the exposed fakir, as it turned
out.</p>
<p>Doc Merritt must have easily guessed who
was chiefly to blame for his latest troubles.
When the scouts were taking his wretched
dupe in hand, and leading him away from the
controlling influence of the hypnotist, the man
understood just whom he had to thank.</p>
<p>He was of a morose, revengeful disposition,
and after brooding over the situation through
that night determined that before he quitted
the lucrative stand he had at the Fair he would
attempt to have some sort of revenge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Hugh, it will be remembered, had not fancied
his looks from the start. He sized the
man up as not only a humbug but the possessor
of a mean disposition as well. Still he hardly
imagined the bogus doctor would go to the end
he did in order to even the score, and leave
town feeling that he had paid the scouts back
for having taken his valuable assistant away
from him.</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise awaited Hugh that same
Thursday evening after supper. He was called
up on the &rsquo;phone by the head of the School
Board, who informed him that at a late meeting
of the said committee it had been resolved
to give all the members of the Oakvale Troop
of Boy Scouts the entire day off on Friday.</p>
<p>This was done as a small measure of appreciation
for the splendid work the lads were
accomplishing during Fair week.</p>
<p>He desired that Hugh Hardin should get in
communication with all the members of the
troop that evening, and notify them that they
would be at liberty from school duties for the
balance of the week.</p>
<p>Of course this gave the scout master considerable
pleasure. It was not only the fact that
he and his mates were to have a holiday, but it
showed how their work was being appreciated
by the community at large, as represented by
the efficient School Board.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>So Hugh had kept the wire busy for some
little time, with the result that every fellow
who wore the honored khaki in Oakvale went
to bed that night weary enough after a strenuous
day, but with a generous glow around the
region of his boyish heart.</p>
<p>Appreciation is a big thing, and spurs even
a boy on to do his level best. That School
Board knew what it was doing in commending
the scouts for their work. Praise judiciously
bestowed seldom does any harm, but on the
contrary rekindles the fire of determination to
excel.</p>
<p>The gates of the Fair would not open until
ten o&rsquo;clock, but before that time many of the
hard-working scouts were abroad, skirmishing
for strangers in town, or in sundry other ways
trying to earn the right to turn in their badges
early in the day.</p>
<p>Hugh himself had something to do at home,
and did not get started for the grounds until
near the time for the opening of the gates to
the general public.</p>
<p>In fact, Ralph Kenyon and Jack Durham
looked in at the Hardin place on their way,
and were just in time to join the young scout
master.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Chattering like magpies, at first they struck
out along a side road that would make a shortcut
to the grounds, situated some little distance
outside the town limits.</p>
<p>This particular road was not much used by
the general public. It ran through a stretch
of woods that at certain times in the year were
apt to be exceedingly damp. Still, as the
scouts well knew, it would cut down the tramp,
and this meant considerable to fellows who expected
to be on their feet the balance of that
summery day.</p>
<p>Somehow about the time they struck this
patch of timber the conversation seemed to
flag, and no one said anything for several minutes,
though they kept pushing ahead all the
same.</p>
<p>In the distance they could hear the Oakvale
Brass Band practicing at their stand in the
Fair grounds. There was to be some sort of
unusual review on this day, and extra music
would be required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing sure,&rdquo; remarked Jack
Durham, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;our band
isn&rsquo;t in the same class with one I read about the
other day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, Jack?&rdquo; questioned Ralph; &ldquo;tell
us about it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it seems that the advance agent of a
show had struck a certain town, and when trying
to make arrangements for a parade that
would attract attention he chanced to say to
the leading citizen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I understand, sir, that your town boasts
a fine brass band?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, stranger,&rsquo; said the citizen, shaking
his head solemnly; &lsquo;we got a brass band all
right, but we don&rsquo;t boast none of the same&mdash;we
just <i>endures</i> it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph was about to burst into a hearty laugh
when the scout master uttered a warning hiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, there&rsquo;s some one talking ahead
there around that bend, and I thought I caught
a familiar voice that sounded like our Billy
Worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the other two strained their ears to
listen, not that the first thought of anything
out of the way had up to that moment given
them the first sensation of a thrill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>But no sooner did they hear what Billy was
saying than they turned to exchange surprised
glances. Plainly Billy was giving some one a
straight-out defiance. The first suspicion the
trio of scouts had was that some of their old
enemies of the town, the good-for-nothing type
of boys, had crossed Billy&rsquo;s path, and considered
the meeting in the lonely stretch of woods
a splendid chance to pay back old scores.</p>
<p>They quickly realized their mistake, however,
when they heard what Billy was saying
so boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to go around boasting about
having a share in that little game, but since
you ask me if I had a hand in getting Cale
away from your clutches I&rsquo;m free to say <i>I did</i>!
So put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mister
Doc Merritt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! that&rsquo;s the racket, is it?&rdquo; muttered
Jack Durham, beginning to roll back his coat
cuffs as though he scented trouble, and might
not be averse to taking a hand in the same, for
in times past Jack had been something of a
fighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s hurry around there before
he tries to hurt our Billy,&rdquo; suggested Ralph;
and as this suited Hugh to a fraction, they
immediately quickened their pace to a run, and
hurried to the bend in the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Loud and angry voices could now be heard
and that of the baffled fakir rang out above the
tantalizing words Billy was hurling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good notion to take it out of your
hide, no matter what the consequences are.
You boys were the cause of all my trouble. Before
you got your finger in the pie things were
going as smoothly as I could wish, but you had
to get up a pack of lies, and coax my assistant
away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were exerting an evil influence
over Cale,&rdquo; snapped Billy. &ldquo;He just happened
to be a good subject for your silly old hypnotism.
I&rsquo;d like to see you try to make <i>me</i> do
your will. You&rsquo;d have a sweet time of it, Mister
Fakir, and that&rsquo;s right. Now, I&rsquo;m going
ahead to the Fair, and I&rsquo;d trouble you to get
out of my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hold on till I&rsquo;m through with you,
boy,&rdquo; the man was heard to say. &ldquo;You need
taking down off your high horse. For three
cents I&rsquo;d give you the licking you need.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you would, eh? Well, begin and try
it if you think it&rsquo;d be so easy a job!&rdquo; cried
Billy, tauntingly, and as the other fellows came
bustling around the bend just then they saw
he was swinging a stick belligerently, as though
meaning to make the best possible use of the
same should the man actually assault him.</p>
<p>Of course when Hugh and his two companions
put in an appearance the quack doctor instantly
changed his mind. He might have
whipped one scout, though Billy looked as
though he intended to put up a game battle;
but four meant a larger bite than he felt he
could masticate.</p>
<p>So Doc Merritt shrugged his shoulders and
with a sneer on his dark face slipped in among
the trees, his act implying that he had changed
his mind. Nor did any of them think it a duty
to chase after him in order to let the tricky
fellow know what they thought of his cowardly
tactics.</p>
<p>Only Jack Durham did look so disappointed
as he unwillingly unrolled the cuffs of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we hold up just a little, till he
got busy, and had actually hit Billy?&rdquo; was the
burden of his complaint; but the others only
laughed at him, and said things were all right
as they stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>So the four of them continued on their way
to the Fair grounds. Hugh was glad to have
noticed that the fakir looked as though he
might be heading out of Oakvale, perhaps
meaning to intercept the stage running over
the mountain road to another town, where
there was some sort of Harvest Home about
to start among the farmers of the community.
His harvest would come from raking in the
shekels when he had hypnotized the farmers,
and made them believe his cure-all must be the
greatest thing under the sun.</p>
<p>So the third day of the great Fair began,
with the scouts on deck, and just as bent on
earning the right to the title of &ldquo;guides&rdquo; as
ever. Hugh was proud of all they had accomplished;
and his ready words of commendation
always brought a flush of pleasure to the
cheeks of his chums.</p>
<p>The scouts continued to carry out their useful
plan of campaign while the great Fair
lasted. They won golden opinions from visitors
and townspeople for the unfailing courtesy
with which they performed their various labors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Arthur Cameron had a rather difficult surgical
undertaking which he managed with such
astonishing skill as to win a mention of his
work in the next issue of a certain well-known
medical journal. This came about through the
local Red Cross doctor having sent in a highly
complimentary mention of the emergency hospital
on the Fair grounds, and the clever manner
in which the scouts carried out their work
of &ldquo;first aid to the injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not a dissenting opinion in all
Oakvale when a vote of thanks was sent in at
the next meeting of the scouts and which covered
their activities during Fair week. Indeed,
many persons were ready to declare that
the splendid way in which Hugh and his uniformed
followers had carried out their difficult
duties made them proud to say they lived in
Oakvale.</p>
<p>All of this was very pleasant for the boys.
They had had to fight down strong opposition
when the troop was first started, and there had
been numerous skeptics from time to time who
would not see things in their true light; but
as Billy Worth was fond of saying, &ldquo;if you
searched Oakvale with a fine-tooth comb nowadays,
you&rsquo;d find it hard to discover a single
kicker, or one who didn&rsquo;t believe the scout
movement had been the greatest uplifting influence
that had ever struck the town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] chanced to have had a part in the happening
he invariably spoke of it as &ldquo;we did this.&rdquo;
Then in the midst of his story came the appearance
of Peter, the bound boy, with his
thrilling tale concerning the little charges
whom he had had to temporarily abandon
while he went in search of assistance. After
that there followed the finding of the youngsters,
the triumphant return to the farm-house,
the coming of Mr. Barger, and finally, most
astonishing of all, the discovery that the black-faced
man they had supposed was the hired
help should prove to be Addison Prentice&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>As all the scouts knew about the decided
opposition shown by the quarry-owner toward
their organization, when they learned of his
wonderful conversion a series of hearty cheers
made the slumbering echoes in the woods
awaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to make it unanimous for the
scouts in and around Oakvale,&rdquo; asserted Alec,
boisterously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to remember another
person of consequence willing to say a
single word against the troop. We&rsquo;ll have
every patrol filled to the limit before a month [rolls by.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>[... Cale had feared] that it would be his fate to always follow Doc
Merritt about from fair to fair, playing the ignoble
part of assistant to a fakir.</p>
<p>Now, as though the magic wand of a magician
had touched his case, all this was changed.
Walter Osborne had a long letter from him
a week or so later, in which he told how happy
and contented he felt, and that he had already
made application for enlistment in a local troop
of Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was through the manly principles of the
scouts that my salvation came about, you know,
Walter,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m bent on practicing
them, in hopes that I may be able to repay the
heavy debt I owe Hugh Hardin and all the rest
of your splendid chums by passing the favor
along. Perhaps, who knows, I may run across
a boy who needs a friend and adviser, just like
I did; and when I do, it&rsquo;ll make me happier than
I can tell you to help him over the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh felt a mist come over his eyes when he
read all that the boy put in that letter. He realized
that, during the week of the County Fair,
there had come, to a favored few of the scouts,
an opportunity to perform a most charitable
act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>When all the facts were made known at
the next meeting of the troop, the story appealed
strongly to those who had up to then
been in complete ignorance of what had been
going on in their midst. Hugh was also under
the impression that it would do much good.</p>
<p>With the passing of the Fair week, the boys
felt that they could hardly look forward to
much more of consequence that fall. None of
them suspected how circumstances would combine
to bring several members of Oakvale
Troop into the limelight once more ere the
Thanksgiving holidays came around; but that
is just what happened.</p>
<p>If you have enjoyed being in the company of
Hugh and his comrades in these pages, and
would like to learn what next engaged the attention
of these wide-awake lads of Oakvale
Troop, it will pay you to secure the volume that
follows this, and which is published under the
title of &ldquo;The Boy Scouts as Forest Fire
Fighters.&rdquo;</p>
